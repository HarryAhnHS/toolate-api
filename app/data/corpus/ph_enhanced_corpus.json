    "text": "<p>\ud83d\udc4b Hey Hunters! I'm Zach, and here's my story\u2026<br><br>About a year ago I started building custom AI chatbots for businesses\u2014everyone from authors to e-commerce stores, insurance brokers, hospitality teams, even observatories were interested. But I kept running into the same problem:<br>Manually gathering data, embedding it, setting up RAG pipelines, and writing prompt logic over and adjusting it until they clients where happy was very tedious. The clients and I would meet for a hour or so, then I would code the prompts, then we would iterate on this process until they were happy. I thought there had to be a better way so we could do the part both I and the business owners enjoyed doing during our meeting which was training the assistants.<br><br>Eventually, I thought:<br>\u201cWhat if business owners could just train and customize their own ai chatbot\u2014without needing me to code it for them every time? Or what if we could manage it for them so we can quickly train them together in our meetings so they can have them deployed to their customers faster? (also less work for me lol)\u201d<br><br>That sparked everything.<br>The first problem was what was the best way to input the business information that was the least amount of work. For the majority of clients uploading documents and using RAG was easy enough. But then other business owners didn't want to do that much work and requested an easier way. I checked out other solutions that used a UI you can drag &amp; drop lines to different knowledge bases but I knew business owners would loose focus quickly. The second option was let them just add their url and the app would gather business information for them. This seemed to be the fastest way for them to create an ai chatbot and it was the most requested feedback, so I began creating an ai agent that would go out, scrape the data, return it. But this led to a problem where there was too much unnecessary data being scraped (as well as huge context windows for the LLMs) so I had to create another agent that could continuously look at the data coming in, organize it, and them re-organize it at the end to an official knowledge source that was useable by the businesses customer service chatbots. <br><br>So after iterating on the feedback now it's pretty much an ai studio that's a dashboard for designing and training customer service agents. It's general purpose since I currently using the app to solve my own problem by managing clients in various industries chatbots, but feel free to use it for your use case. <br><br>That\u2019s how SmarterChatbots.com was born.<br><br>Now you can: \u2705 Auto-train a chatbot from your website or documents<br>\u2705 Customize the look, tone, and behavior<br>\u2705 Embed it anywhere or share via QR code<br>\u2705 Go live in under 10 minutes<br><br>I\u2019ll admit, I was nervous to hit \u201claunch\u201d here\u2014Product Hunt is full of amazing products, and things might still break \ud83d\ude05\u2014but this is my shot. I\u2019d love for you to give it a try.<br><br>Some fun chatbot ideas people have created on our platform: <br>\u2705 An author of children's books trained various characters on the books and added the QR code to the end of her book so kids could interact and play a game with the characters. Each character was context aware of who they were and where they were in the story. <br>\u2705 My friend who owns a mobile auto mechanic business created one to diagnose preliminary auto issues and help him estimate pricing. <br>\u2705 A few businesses in the hospitality industry created chatbots trained to engage in customers to answer questions about what the experience is like, ticket pricing, menu &amp; drink options and events that where hidden on their website.  <br><br>\ud83d\udcac Feedback, feature requests, or even \u201cthis part was confusing\u201d messages are all welcome.<br>This indie project is all about learning how to make training and deploying AI chatbots truly effortless.<br><br>Thanks for being here \ud83d\ude4f<br>\u2014 Zach</p>",

It's incredibly powerful!\n\n    But here's the challenge: moving those cool MCP integrations from a local setup to a secure, shared production or enterprise environment brings a whole new set of critical requirements. Suddenly, you need robust answers to:\n\n        Who is really making this request in a multi-user system? (AuthN)\n\n        Are they authorized to use this specific tool or access that sensitive data? (RBAC)\n\n        How do we securely manage and inject API keys for shared services without scattering secrets? (Credentials)\n\n        How do we get reliable audit logs for security monitoring and compliance? (Auditing)\n\n    Implementing this essential governance layer consistently across every MCP tool is complex, repetitive, and easy to get wrong.\n\n    That's why I built the Ithena SDK! It's an open-source (Apache-2.0) TypeScript library designed specifically to provide this missing enterprise-grade governance layer for your MCP servers.\n\n    Ithena gives you a pluggable pipeline to easily add Identity, RBAC, Credential Management, and Auditing capabilities, letting your team focus on building great MCP features, knowing the security and compliance aspects are handled consistently.\n\n    While you could use parts of it locally, its real power is unlocked when deploying MCP services where security, compliance, and observability are non-negotiable.\n\n    We also have a waitlist open for an optional Managed Platform if you want hosted, production-ready backends for these interfaces later.\n\n    Dive into the GitHub repo and docs to see how it works!\n\n    Curious to hear: How are you tackling security and governance when taking MCP tools beyond local experiments and into shared or production environments? What are the biggest hurdles you've faced?\n\n    Cheers!",

    "text": "<p>Hi Product Hunters!<br><br>I built LLMSymphony because I wanted a simple, clean, incognito by-default way to chat with the best remote AI models natively on windows, with an interface that will be familiar to MS Teams users.<br><br>I have tested a number of local LLM tools for privacy, but they can only run distilled or smaller models. And the ones I have checked - chats are saved unencrypted to disk by default! While some of them now supports remote models, I wanted a more simplified and efficient UI for switching AI models and providers.<br><br>With providers like DeepInfra.com / Together.ai with Nvidia H100 GPU's that can run high parameter / mixture of expert models like DeepSeek, and that chat logging is often off by default with developer accounts, this gave me the idea that I don't need run expensive servers with GPUs to get privacy, as long as the client is secure as well. <br><br>I have built pre-configured Profiles for GPT-4o, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, and Grok with a 'one-click' setup using your own API keys. In fact, it supports any remote or local LLMs (e.g. Ollama) as long as the model interaction is via OpenAI API Compatible spec. <br><br>The app is free to trial for 7 days, and just a one off $12 if you decide to keep it (lifetime of upgrades). It is certified by the Windows Store for your piece of mind.<br><br>So who is this for? Someone who wants to chat with advanced LLM models remotely, and want to minimize exposure to data breach events and (default) information harvesting practices if you were to use the public web models. Or just want to switch between AI models really fast in a single chat thread. <br><br>Would love your feedback, questions or launch support! AMA!</p>",

    "text": "Hey PH community!\n\nToday, we\u2019re launching DGi after months of hunkering down and pair programming with my CTO. Our journey over the past seven years has been full of ups and downs: we scaled a martech company to around 160 people, but when COVID hit, we couldn\u2019t fully bounce back. Our team dissolved, and only my CTO stayed on to keep searching for product-market fit with almost no resources.\n\nDespite it all, we built a pretty cool data workflow product used by several Fortune 500 companies. It felt too cumbersome and time consuming\u2014but it made us profitable. We took that lesson and poured our learnings into our next big bet.\n\nRather than seeing the past as failure, we saw it as proof that every struggle, every pivot, and every lesson would lead us here, stronger than ever.\n\nWhat is DGi?\nSimply put, DGi is an AI agent specialized in data that builds and it is entirely built by AI. It isn\u2019t locked into any fixed front or back end. At its core, it embodies \u201cvisual empathy\u201d: we give you a sleek interface for adding credentials, so you\u2019re not wrangling config files. We let you interact visually, not just via chat. And, of course, we deliver dashboards that are both appealing and easy to navigate.\nWe built DGi using Next.js and Shadcn components because we admire Guillermo\u2019s (Founder of Vercel) philosophy and wanted to bring that same level of tasteful design into the data space.\n\nIn a nutshell with DGi you can:\nConnect to your data or upload files\nCreate dashboards or ask questions about your data\nRun code\nSchedule tasks to orchestrate (just like Airflow)\nIn essence we are a combination between ChatGPT, v0 and Airflow.\nMore on DGi at <a href=\"http://www.dgintel.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">www.dgintel.ai</a>\n\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\nWe believe data exploration should be AI-based from the start. Eventually, tools like Excel and Power BI may fade away if a single product can handle everything\u2014uploading a CSV, connecting a database, creating dashboards, asking questions, and automating workflows. That\u2019s our dream, and DGi is the first step toward making it real.\n\nWe hope you love it as much as we do. You can try it now, for free.\n\nPlus here\u2019s our commitment, if you try it out and you find a bug or want a feature we don\u2019t have, we will fix it or implement it right away.  We know there\u2019s many things to improve. For example we want to update users while DGi is \u201cThinking\u201d. We will bring streaming very soon.\n\nAlso, share what you built with the hashtag #dgi and tag us @datagran on X by April 15 for a chance to win $1,000. The most impressive implementation takes it.\n\nFinally we\u2019ve raised more than $5m thus far but we are opening a community round on Wefunder to give anyone the chance to invest in the future of data <a href=\"https://wefunder.com/datagran\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://wefunder.com/datagran</a>",

One potential challenge with that is that I might want to add team members who are not in the support team but occasionally need to assist on some tickets (i.e. engineering team lets say).

I like how even with this initial launch you got quite a few advanced features - I.e. the knowledge base editor looks good.

They are drawn to Neo's features, such as its knowledge base editor, and are curious about the capabilities of its AI in learning from and utilizing the knowledge added to the knowledge base. However, they do have some reservations about Neo's pricing model, specifically the X AI interactions per seat structure, which they feel may not be ideal for their use case, as it could lead to underutilization of quotas by occasional users, such as engineering team members who may only assist with tickets sporadically. They suggest that a shared quota across the account would be more attractive, allowing for more flexibility in team collaboration. Overall, the user is impressed with Neo's initial launch and the inclusion of advanced features, and is considering giving it a try as a more cost-effective and efficient solution for their customer service needs once their product launches.",

Over the last decade, we\u2019ve helped companies enable real-time collaboration on the web. As part of co-browsing, you need to be able to share any web session. To do that, we built a technology that can <em>take any existing web application and turn it into a virtual session</em> \u2014 one that\u2019s shareable, customizable, and collaborative. That underlying capability ended up being our biggest breakthrough.<br></p><br><p><strong>Why we\u2019re launching Webfuse</strong></p><br><p>Over the years, we\u2019ve seen a few of our most creative customers build <em>incredible</em> tools on top of our tech. They used it to translate legacy applications in real time, sandbox existing web application for privacy, inject new UI into legacy tools, and even power AI-driven assistants that run inside existing web apps.</p><br><p>We always wanted to explore this potential further \u2014 but we weren\u2019t ready. the technology wasn\u2019t mature enough to open up broadly. So we focused on a small group of customers, iterated quietly\u2026 and now, we\u2019re finally ready to share what we\u2019ve built with the world. Introducing <em>Webfuse</em> \u2014 world's first <em>Web Augmentation Platform</em>.</p><p><br><br></p><p><strong>Why nobody else has done this</strong></p><br><p>Until now, your options for modifying existing web apps were limited to:</p><ul><li><p>\ud83d\udd0c <em>Browser extensions</em> (local, requires installation)</p><ul><li><p>eg: <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/plasmo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@Plasmo</a> <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/extensionpay\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@ExtensionPay</a> <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/chatgpt-sidebar-chrome-extension\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@Sider: AI Research Agent &amp; Extension</a> <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/keepitcloaked\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@Cloaked</a> <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/merlin-chatgpt-powered-browser-cmd-g\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@Merlin - ChatGPT powered chrome extension (Cmd+M)</a> <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/frase\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@Frase</a> <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/monica-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@Monica</a> <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/subtly\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@Subtly</a> <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/factory-confirm-by-sourcify\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@Factory Confirm by Sourcify</a> , ...</p></li></ul></li><li><p>\ud83c\udf10 <em>Remote browsers</em> (lower quality as you are streaming pixels)</p></li><li><p>\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f <em>CDN/Edge code injection</em> (requires infrastructure control)</p></li></ul><p>But Webfuse is different. We rewrite the application in real-time and run it in a controlled environment \u2014 one where we can change, monitor, and extend it as needed. It\u2019s a technically complex problem, especially with how fast the web evolves \u2014 but after 10+ years of experience building in this space, we\u2019ve finally cracked it.</p><p><br><br></p><p><strong>How it works</strong></p><br><p>Webfuse wraps any existing web application in a thin virtualization layer \u2014 a \u201cvirtual session\u201d \u2014 where everything can be customized without touching the original source. Once you sign up, you can create a <em>SPACE</em>, which is essentially a smart, shareable link that opens a set of virtualized web apps. From there, you can:</p><ul><li><p>Modify the UI</p></li><li><p>Add security/authentication</p></li><li><p>Inject automation</p></li><li><p>Record &amp; monitor sessions</p></li><li><p>Share with others (like multiplayer mode for any app)</p></li></ul><p>All without needing source code access.</p><p><br><br></p><p><strong>Features</strong></p><ul><li><p>\ud83d\udd10 <em>Security Layers</em> \u2013 Add auth, HTTP-only cookie isolation, audit logs</p></li><li><p>\ud83d\udcf9 <em>Session Recording</em> \u2013 Full video streams of interactions</p></li><li><p>\ud83d\udcc8 <em>Monitoring &amp; Logs</em> \u2013 Real-time JSON-based session audit trail</p></li><li><p>\ud83e\udd16 <em>Automation</em> \u2013 Remote control API for bots and agents</p></li><li><p>\ud83e\udd1d <em>Collaboration</em> \u2013 Share sessions with multiple users in real-time</p></li><li><p>\ud83c\udfa5 <em>Video Chat</em> \u2013 Add video calls to <em>any</em> web app</p></li><li><p>\ud83e\udde9 <em>Custom Extensions</em> \u2013 Build and inject your own logic using a browser-extension-like API<br><br></p></li></ul><p><strong>Why Webfuse is unique</strong></p><br><p>Webfuse enables a new category: Web Augmentation. Instead of building a new app from scratch or waiting for vendors to release features, you can build on top of what already exists \u2014 instantly. You can even turn browser extensions into managed SaaS tools without client-side installs.

    "text": "9 months ago, I quit my 6-year role at a startup. I felt lost and didn\u2019t know what I was going to do with my life. One evening, I realized I had no time left in my day anymore, and something had changed. I was holding my iPhone 15 Pro Max, and I couldn\u2019t understand why I was spending so much more time on it compared to my old slow Android phone. This phone was different. The shimmering colors on the screen invited me to keep using it, and everything was buttery smooth. Apps on the main screens were all bright and colorful, making it so easy to engage with.\n\nI started thinking about how things were when I had my old Samsung my battery would die every 3-4 hours. Yet now, with this iPhone, I found myself constantly plugged in. It dawned on me that I didn\u2019t even know screen time existed. On the iPhone, it\u2019s buried somewhere hard to find, almost as if they were hiding it. It looked like something from the 1990s an old graph, nothing like the sleek and beautiful health app graphs they charge for.\n\nThat\u2019s when I began digging deeper into how social media uses behavioral psychology to manipulate us. I learned how they employed thousands of psychologists to make their platforms as addictive as possible. One simple example? The little circles at the end of a story showing who viewed it. Suddenly, you're in the middle of doing something, but you want to check who saw your story. The pressure mounts, especially when you're somewhere expensive like traveling and you feel like you have to post about it. You\u2019re not posting for you; you\u2019re posting to be the mule for your friends who can\u2019t live the life you\u2019re living.\n\nAs someone who got into coding to build the life I wanted, I started noticing how the addiction to these platforms was making everyone else miss out on the real world. On a train, I saw 9 out of 10 people doomscrolling. Kids waking up, stuck on their phones all weekend. It hit me: I hated everything about social media.\n\nI decided the next product I needed to create had to be about data science and AI, combining both passions to create something that could help people regain control of their time. That\u2019s how Blissio.ai was born.\n\nBlissio.ai is a personalized digital wellness tool. It asks simple questions like your age, profession, and hobbies, and based on those, it creates focus sessions tailored specifically for you. We block apps based on what you need, whether for work, your hobbies, or age group. This way, we\u2019re not arbitrarily blocking things, but helping you focus on what matters most.\n\nI\u2019m so excited to share this with you all! How do you manage your screen time? Would love to hear your thoughts below! \ud83d\udc47",
