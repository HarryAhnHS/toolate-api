Sure, you could just tell them to read the prompt and fill our the bits they need, but we all know nobody reads on the internet! \n\nSo, I created this simple free tool which lets you drop in a prompt and set up what info people need to add. You can set the type of each field so you can ask for numbers, long/short text or even a selection from a dropdown.\n\nAnyone you share the link with can then easily enter the required data and get their own version of the prompt to copy and paste. Meaning more consistent results and hopefully fewer questions on what they need to do!"

Or sometimes, they'd just translate the idiom into something equivalent in the target language. Thus losing the color of the original phrasing.  This is terrible for language learners.\n\nSeeing this actually inspired me to build something specifically to help with that problem: BestFuckingTranslator.com. The goal is to provide translations that capture the meaning and nuance of idiomatic expressions, in addition to the literal words. Both of those things are important for language learners. \n \n\nHere an of example of how it handles things differently:\n\nEnglish to Spanish:\n\nPhrase: \"You need to bite the bullet and tell him.\"\n\nGoogle Translate: \"Tienes que agarrar la bala y decirle.\" (Doesn't make sense in Spanish)\n\nBestFingTranslator: \"Tienes que morder la bala y dec\u00edrselo. (Necesitas enfrentarte a la situaci\u00f3n y hablar con \u00e9l.)\"\n\nSource text can be in basically any language in the world. The AI does a good job of detecting it. For target language, currently 60+ languages are supported. If you find your language missing, please let me know, I'll add it."

If you're building AI apps or features, you can use this to monitor your LLM calls for cost, usage, and performance issues.\n\nThe project includes a Tinybird backend to store and process LLM call events, and a Next app frontend to visualize critical LLM metrics such as cost by model, TTFT, total requests/tokens used, etc. All of the visualizations can be filtered and drilled down by a bunch of different dimensions.\n\nWe designed this to be used as is: you can deploy it to Vercel/Tinybird for free and instrument your app to start sending LLM calls (you can find examples for LiteLLM and Vercel AI SDK in the repo).\n\nThe app also includes a template for adding multi-tenancy via Clerk. This can be useful if you'd like to modify the components and integrate them into your app to give your users visibility over their LLM usage in your application.\n\nWe'd love to hear your feedback and how you might use/extend this. Of course, it's open source, and PRs are welcome!\n\nIf you have any questions, the Tinybird Slack community has answers :)"

The idea was born from my own frustrations as an AI engineer trying to manage prompt development across multiple projects.\n\nI found myself constantly switching between text editors, Jupyter notebooks, and various testing scripts - with no consistent way to track versions, measure performance, or seamlessly deploy to production. My team was also struggling with knowledge sharing and standardization.\n\nAfter talking with dozens of AI developers, I realized this wasn't just my problem - the entire industry is lacking proper tooling for prompt engineering, despite it becoming a crucial skill.\n\nThat's why we built KitchenAI as a complete studio that brings together experimentation, testing, metrics, and deployment in one sleek developer experience.\n\nI'd love to hear from other AI developers and product teams:\n- What's your current workflow for prompt engineering?\n- Which part of the process causes the most headaches?\n- What features would make your prompt development process 10x better?\n\nJoin our waitlist to get early access and help shape the future of professional prompt engineering!"

You know the drill: someone suggests a date, three people are unavailable, someone forgot the timezone, another replies late, and suddenly\u2026 the event never happens.\n\nQuickPoll solves that in seconds.\n\nYou just describe your event in plain English/French/Spanish \u2014 like \u201cTeam meeting next week, Monday at 10am or Wednesday at 2pm\u201d \u2014 and the AI does the heavy lifting:\n\u2192 It extracts the possible dates and times\n\u2192 Creates a clean, shareable poll\n\u2192 No signup required for you or participants\n\u2192 You get email notifications when people vote\n\u2192 And yes, you can add a password if you want to keep it private\n\nWhy does it matter?\nBecause the alternatives (like Doodle or When2Meet) still require a lot of clicking, form filling, and account creation. QuickPoll strips all that away. It\u2019s fast, intuitive, and focused on doing one thing really well: helping people agree on a date, fast.\n\nIt\u2019s completely free, and you don\u2019t need to create an account to use it.\n\nI\u2019d love your feedback, ideas, and maybe even a little upvote if you think QuickPoll can help others like it helped me. \ud83d\ude4c\n\nThanks for checking it out!"

I'm Zach, and here's my story\u2026<br><br>About a year ago I started building custom AI chatbots for businesses\u2014everyone from authors to e-commerce stores, insurance brokers, hospitality teams, even observatories were interested. But I kept running into the same problem:<br>Manually gathering data, embedding it, setting up RAG pipelines, and writing prompt logic over and adjusting it until they clients where happy was very tedious. The clients and I would meet for a hour or so, then I would code the prompts, then we would iterate on this process until they were happy. I thought there had to be a better way so we could do the part both I and the business owners enjoyed doing during our meeting which was training the assistants.<br><br>Eventually, I thought:<br>\u201cWhat if business owners could just train and customize their own ai chatbot\u2014without needing me to code it for them every time? Or what if we could manage it for them so we can quickly train them together in our meetings so they can have them deployed to their customers faster? (also less work for me lol)\u201d<br><br>That sparked everything.<br>The first problem was what was the best way to input the business information that was the least amount of work. For the majority of clients uploading documents and using RAG was easy enough. But then other business owners didn't want to do that much work and requested an easier way. I checked out other solutions that used a UI you can drag &amp; drop lines to different knowledge bases but I knew business owners would loose focus quickly. The second option was let them just add their url and the app would gather business information for them. This seemed to be the fastest way for them to create an ai chatbot and it was the most requested feedback, so I began creating an ai agent that would go out, scrape the data, return it. But this led to a problem where there was too much unnecessary data being scraped (as well as huge context windows for the LLMs) so I had to create another agent that could continuously look at the data coming in, organize it, and them re-organize it at the end to an official knowledge source that was useable by the businesses customer service chatbots. <br><br>So after iterating on the feedback now it's pretty much an ai studio that's a dashboard for designing and training customer service agents. It's general purpose since I currently using the app to solve my own problem by managing clients in various industries chatbots, but feel free to use it for your use case. <br><br>That\u2019s how SmarterChatbots.com was born.<br><br>Now you can: \u2705 Auto-train a chatbot from your website or documents<br>\u2705 Customize the look, tone, and behavior<br>\u2705 Embed it anywhere or share via QR code<br>\u2705 Go live in under 10 minutes<br><br>I\u2019ll admit, I was nervous to hit \u201claunch\u201d here\u2014Product Hunt is full of amazing products, and things might still break \ud83d\ude05\u2014but this is my shot. I\u2019d love for you to give it a try.<br><br>Some fun chatbot ideas people have created on our platform: <br>\u2705 An author of children's books trained various characters on the books and added the QR code to the end of her book so kids could interact and play a game with the characters. Each character was context aware of who they were and where they were in the story. <br>\u2705 My friend who owns a mobile auto mechanic business created one to diagnose preliminary auto issues and help him estimate pricing. <br>\u2705 A few businesses in the hospitality industry created chatbots trained to engage in customers to answer questions about what the experience is like, ticket pricing, menu &amp; drink options and events that where hidden on their website.  <br><br>\ud83d\udcac Feedback, feature requests, or even \u201cthis part was confusing\u201d messages are all welcome.<br>This indie project is all about learning how to make training and deploying AI chatbots truly effortless.<br><br>Thanks for being here \ud83d\ude4f<br>\u2014 Zach</p>"

            "body": "Hey Product Hunt! \ud83d\udc4b\n\n    Super excited to share the Ithena SDK (@ithena-one/mcp-governance) today!\n\n    We're seeing the Model Context Protocol (MCP) unlock amazing potential, letting AI models interact with everything from local filesystems and apps to complex enterprise systems. It's incredibly powerful!\n\n    But here's the challenge: moving those cool MCP integrations from a local setup to a secure, shared production or enterprise environment brings a whole new set of critical requirements. Suddenly, you need robust answers to:\n\n        Who is really making this request in a multi-user system? (AuthN)\n\n        Are they authorized to use this specific tool or access that sensitive data? (RBAC)\n\n        How do we securely manage and inject API keys for shared services without scattering secrets? (Credentials)\n\n        How do we get reliable audit logs for security monitoring and compliance? (Auditing)\n\n    Implementing this essential governance layer consistently across every MCP tool is complex, repetitive, and easy to get wrong.\n\n    That's why I built the Ithena SDK! It's an open-source (Apache-2.0) TypeScript library designed specifically to provide this missing enterprise-grade governance layer for your MCP servers.\n\n    Ithena gives you a pluggable pipeline to easily add Identity, RBAC, Credential Management, and Auditing capabilities, letting your team focus on building great MCP features, knowing the security and compliance aspects are handled consistently.\n\n    While you could use parts of it locally, its real power is unlocked when deploying MCP services where security, compliance, and observability are non-negotiable.\n\n    We also have a waitlist open for an optional Managed Platform if you want hosted, production-ready backends for these interfaces later.\n\n    Dive into the GitHub repo and docs to see how it works!\n\n    Curious to hear: How are you tackling security and governance when taking MCP tools beyond local experiments and into shared or production environments? What are the biggest hurdles you've faced?\n\n    Cheers!"

And the ones I have checked - chats are saved unencrypted to disk by default! While some of them now supports remote models, I wanted a more simplified and efficient UI for switching AI models and providers.<br><br>With providers like DeepInfra.com / Together.ai with Nvidia H100 GPU's that can run high parameter / mixture of expert models like DeepSeek, and that chat logging is often off by default with developer accounts, this gave me the idea that I don't need run expensive servers with GPUs to get privacy, as long as the client is secure as well. <br><br>I have built pre-configured Profiles for GPT-4o, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, and Grok with a 'one-click' setup using your own API keys. In fact, it supports any remote or local LLMs (e.g. Ollama) as long as the model interaction is via OpenAI API Compatible spec. <br><br>The app is free to trial for 7 days, and just a one off $12 if you decide to keep it (lifetime of upgrades). It is certified by the Windows Store for your piece of mind.<br><br>So who is this for? Someone who wants to chat with advanced LLM models remotely, and want to minimize exposure to data breach events and (default) information harvesting practices if you were to use the public web models. Or just want to switch between AI models really fast in a single chat thread. <br><br>Would love your feedback, questions or launch support! AMA!</p>"

            "body": "Hey PH community!\n\nToday, we\u2019re launching DGi after months of hunkering down and pair programming with my CTO. Our journey over the past seven years has been full of ups and downs: we scaled a martech company to around 160 people, but when COVID hit, we couldn\u2019t fully bounce back. Our team dissolved, and only my CTO stayed on to keep searching for product-market fit with almost no resources.\n\nDespite it all, we built a pretty cool data workflow product used by several Fortune 500 companies. It felt too cumbersome and time consuming\u2014but it made us profitable. We took that lesson and poured our learnings into our next big bet.\n\nRather than seeing the past as failure, we saw it as proof that every struggle, every pivot, and every lesson would lead us here, stronger than ever.\n\nWhat is DGi?\nSimply put, DGi is an AI agent specialized in data that builds and it is entirely built by AI. It isn\u2019t locked into any fixed front or back end. At its core, it embodies \u201cvisual empathy\u201d: we give you a sleek interface for adding credentials, so you\u2019re not wrangling config files. We let you interact visually, not just via chat. And, of course, we deliver dashboards that are both appealing and easy to navigate.\nWe built DGi using Next.js and Shadcn components because we admire Guillermo\u2019s (Founder of Vercel) philosophy and wanted to bring that same level of tasteful design into the data space.\n\nIn a nutshell with DGi you can:\nConnect to your data or upload files\nCreate dashboards or ask questions about your data\nRun code\nSchedule tasks to orchestrate (just like Airflow)\nIn essence we are a combination between ChatGPT, v0 and Airflow.\nMore on DGi at <a href=\"http://www.dgintel.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">www.dgintel.ai</a>\n\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\nWe believe data exploration should be AI-based from the start. Eventually, tools like Excel and Power BI may fade away if a single product can handle everything\u2014uploading a CSV, connecting a database, creating dashboards, asking questions, and automating workflows. That\u2019s our dream, and DGi is the first step toward making it real.\n\nWe hope you love it as much as we do. You can try it now, for free.\n\nPlus here\u2019s our commitment, if you try it out and you find a bug or want a feature we don\u2019t have, we will fix it or implement it right away.  We know there\u2019s many things to improve. For example we want to update users while DGi is \u201cThinking\u201d. We will bring streaming very soon.\n\nAlso, share what you built with the hashtag #dgi and tag us @datagran on X by April 15 for a chance to win $1,000. The most impressive implementation takes it.\n\nFinally we\u2019ve raised more than $5m thus far but we are opening a community round on Wefunder to give anyone the chance to invest in the future of data <a href=\"https://wefunder.com/datagran\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://wefunder.com/datagran</a>"

You can use the free plan with smaller codebases, and you can upgrade to the bigger ones accordingly.\n\nIf you believe there's something SeniorAI could help you achieve in your development process, let us know at <a href=\"mailto:hello@seniorai.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">hello@seniorai.ai</a>, or on Linkedin at: <a href=\"https://linkedin.com/company/senior-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://linkedin.com/company/sen...</a> \n\nWould love any advice and feedback, and if you have a startup and would like to hop on a call to discuss about your engineering pain points, let us know.\n\nPS: I will announce the latests updates on X as well: <a href=\"https://x.com/sash20m\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://x.com/sash20m</a> .

One potential challenge with that is that I might want to add team members who are not in the support team but occasionally need to assist on some tickets (i.e. engineering team lets say).

One thing that frustrated us was how medical data comes in all these weird formats. So we made sure QuackRead can handle pretty much anything you throw at it - ISOs, PDFs, ZIPs, and even DICOM files. \n\nTo be clear - QuackRead is purely an educational tool. It's not for medical diagnosis. We designed it to satisfy users' curiosity about what AI systems might observe in their medical data. Consider it as an additional perspective that can help you better understand medical information, but always defer to healthcare professionals for actual medical advice.\n\nPlease let us know what you think!"

This app lets you see answers from five of the best AI companies, summarizes their answers for you, and provides a summary table. This process allows you to easily spot hallucinations in certain AI models and companies. And lets you make better decisions. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/qu8FTyaLc9k\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Demo</a>.</p><br><p>There is Debater that can debate any topic. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/JZzebg9gNt4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Demo</a>.</p><p><br>Then the app has a list of interesting questions to get you started with (think Quora). <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/eJlbhXwZkTQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Demo</a>.</p><br><p>There is also a social network where users can post questions and follow each other (think Twitter). <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/rtTdWHrBUPA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Demo</a>.</p><p><br>In addition to this, it has several interesting councils (groups of AI assistants) that give you perspectives from \"across the aisle\".

My resume was completely ignored by recruiters.<br><br>I got really frustrated by the thought of how different my chances would be if recruiters could actually see my projects instead of just reading about them.<br><br>So I built a simple tool to transform my plain text resume into something that showcased my actual work. Some positive feedback from friends in similar situations, and a few rabbit holes later, Profolio was born.<br><br>It's currently in beta with a free tier that lets anyone try the AI enhancements. While it's still evolving, I've got a roadmap of features that will make it even more powerful for job seekers.<br><br>If you've ever been overlooked because your resume couldn't capture what you can actually do, I'd love for you to try it out.

It started after the birth of my second daughter, Athena, when I was trying to find a way to effectively remember all the hacks and insights I learned each day. I needed a system that both kept me organized with as little work possible, but more importantly, one that reminded me of the information when I needed it. </p><br><p>Yes, I tried my phone's note-taking app (along with some others). We can all agree that the note-taking apps out there are messy, overly complicated, and cannot make the data actionable. There was no way they would help me remember to order a different meal next time I come back to this restaurant.\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f</p><br><p>So I decided to build an all-in-one solution...an app that functions like a second brain. </p><br><p>MYNDIFY has:</p><p>\u2705 A pre-built infrastructure to organize your mental notes. Entries are connected as they are created so I don't have to spend time \"making folders\". </p><p>     EG: my \"don't order this meal again\" entry will be tied to the Bob's Bistro record it pertains to (along with other entries like \"there's better parking in the back\" or \"remember you have a coupon\")</p><p>\u2705 Features allowing for each entry to become actionable. So when I go back to Bob's Bistro, MYNDIFY can remind me (automatically) not to order that meal again. </p><p>\u2705 AI generated answers to our questions. With MYNDIFY's Inky chatbot, you can get answers to questions like \"What was the name of the place I took the kids apple picking?\" or \"Which of my friends is vegan?\". </p><br><p>These are just some of the many features MYNDIFY has!</p><br><p>I, along with some of the other early adopters, are obsessed with how useful it is. I absolutely LOVE getting reminders like what to ask the doctor about during our pediatric visits. What about you? How useful is your notes app? What would you love to get reminders for?</p><br>"

While integrating LLMs into my work projects, I kept running into the same issue \u2014 tracking LLM usage and costs for each user. Every time, I had to build a custom solution from scratch.\n\nSo, I built an <a href=\"https://affordai.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Afford AI</a>, a simple analytics tool to handle it.\n\nHow it works?\n1) Add your app &amp; choose an LLM model;\n2) Get an API token;\n3) Send LLM usage events into our API.\n\nThe dashboard shows token consumption, costs, and top users. Pay-as-you-go, no subscriptions, and free usage available. \n\nHappy to be in touch with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyrylo-alokhin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">LinkedIn</a>\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your feedback and ideas for improvement!"

The SDK also allows combining these AI-driven commands with custom Python code, API calls, or direct Playwright manipulation for more control.\n\nKey aspects:\n\n\ud83e\udd16 Powers Browser Agents: The underlying AI model for web automation.\n\u2705 Focus on Reliability: Designed for accurate execution of individual web interaction steps (claims &gt;90% on internal tests).\n\ud83d\udcbb SDK for Developers: The primary way to build with Nova Act right now, offering fine-grained control.\n\ud83d\udcca Strong Benchmarks: Amazon reports strong performance on UI interaction benchmarks like ScreenSpot and GroundUI Web.\n\ud83d\udd2c Research Preview: This is an early release for experimentation.\n\nAmazon sees this focus on reliable building blocks as key for future agent capabilities."

            "body": "<p>\ud83d\udc4b Hey Product Hunt!<br></p><p>I\u2019m the founder of Surfly, where we\u2019ve been building co-browsing technology since 2012. Over the last decade, we\u2019ve helped companies enable real-time collaboration on the web. As part of co-browsing, you need to be able to share any web session. To do that, we built a technology that can <em>take any existing web application and turn it into a virtual session</em> \u2014 one that\u2019s shareable, customizable, and collaborative. That underlying capability ended up being our biggest breakthrough.<br></p><br><p><strong>Why we\u2019re launching Webfuse</strong></p><br><p>Over the years, we\u2019ve seen a few of our most creative customers build <em>incredible</em> tools on top of our tech. They used it to translate legacy applications in real time, sandbox existing web application for privacy, inject new UI into legacy tools, and even power AI-driven assistants that run inside existing web apps.</p><br><p>We always wanted to explore this potential further \u2014 but we weren\u2019t ready. the technology wasn\u2019t mature enough to open up broadly. So we focused on a small group of customers, iterated quietly\u2026 and now, we\u2019re finally ready to share what we\u2019ve built with the world. Introducing <em>Webfuse</em> \u2014 world's first <em>Web Augmentation Platform</em>.</p><p><br><br></p><p><strong>Why nobody else has done this</strong></p><br><p>Until now, your options for modifying existing web apps were limited to:</p><ul><li><p>\ud83d\udd0c <em>Browser extensions</em> (local, requires installation)</p><ul><li><p>eg: <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/plasmo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@Plasmo</a> <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/extensionpay\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@ExtensionPay</a> <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/chatgpt-sidebar-chrome-extension\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@Sider: AI Research Agent &amp; Extension</a> <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/keepitcloaked\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@Cloaked</a> <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/merlin-chatgpt-powered-browser-cmd-g\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@Merlin - ChatGPT powered chrome extension (Cmd+M)</a> <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/frase\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@Frase</a> <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/monica-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@Monica</a> <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/subtly\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@Subtly</a> <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/factory-confirm-by-sourcify\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@Factory Confirm by Sourcify</a> , ...</p></li></ul></li><li><p>\ud83c\udf10 <em>Remote browsers</em> (lower quality as you are streaming pixels)</p></li><li><p>\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f <em>CDN/Edge code injection</em> (requires infrastructure control)</p></li></ul><p>But Webfuse is different. We rewrite the application in real-time and run it in a controlled environment \u2014 one where we can change, monitor, and extend it as needed. It\u2019s a technically complex problem, especially with how fast the web evolves \u2014 but after 10+ years of experience building in this space, we\u2019ve finally cracked it.</p><p><br><br></p><p><strong>How it works</strong></p><br><p>Webfuse wraps any existing web application in a thin virtualization layer \u2014 a \u201cvirtual session\u201d \u2014 where everything can be customized without touching the original source. Once you sign up, you can create a <em>SPACE</em>, which is essentially a smart, shareable link that opens a set of virtualized web apps. From there, you can:</p><ul><li><p>Modify the UI</p></li><li><p>Add security/authentication</p></li><li><p>Inject automation</p></li><li><p>Record &amp; monitor sessions</p></li><li><p>Share with others (like multiplayer mode for any app)</p></li></ul><p>All without needing source code access.</p><p><br><br></p><p><strong>Features</strong></p><ul><li><p>\ud83d\udd10 <em>Security Layers</em> \u2013 Add auth, HTTP-only cookie isolation, audit logs</p></li><li><p>\ud83d\udcf9 <em>Session Recording</em> \u2013 Full video streams of interactions</p></li><li><p>\ud83d\udcc8 <em>Monitoring &amp; Logs</em> \u2013 Real-time JSON-based session audit trail</p></li><li><p>\ud83e\udd16 <em>Automation</em> \u2013 Remote control API for bots and agents</p></li><li><p>\ud83e\udd1d <em>Collaboration</em> \u2013 Share sessions with multiple users in real-time</p></li><li><p>\ud83c\udfa5 <em>Video Chat</em> \u2013 Add video calls to <em>any</em> web app</p></li><li><p>\ud83e\udde9 <em>Custom Extensions</em> \u2013 Build and inject your own logic using a browser-extension-like API<br><br></p></li></ul><p><strong>Why Webfuse is unique</strong></p><br><p>Webfuse enables a new category: Web Augmentation. Instead of building a new app from scratch or waiting for vendors to release features, you can build on top of what already exists \u2014 instantly. You can even turn browser extensions into managed SaaS tools without client-side installs. Whether you're a developer, founder, automator, or hacker \u2014 this is your canvas to remix the web.</p><p><br><br></p><p><strong>Our roadmap</strong></p><p>We\u2019re just getting started. Right now, Webfuse supports the basics of the browser extension API. Based on your feedback, we\u2019ll expand the capabilities, improve performance, and build a full ecosystem around this idea \u2014 including:</p><ul><li><p>Extension marketplace</p></li><li><p>No-code UI builder</p></li><li><p>AI assistants integration</p></li><li><p>Private cloud deployment<br></p></li></ul><p><strong>Join us early \u2014 let\u2019s build together</strong></p><br><p>We\u2019re offering <strong>$100 in credits </strong>for Product Hunt users.

            "body": "9 months ago, I quit my 6-year role at a startup. I felt lost and didn\u2019t know what I was going to do with my life. One evening, I realized I had no time left in my day anymore, and something had changed. I was holding my iPhone 15 Pro Max, and I couldn\u2019t understand why I was spending so much more time on it compared to my old slow Android phone. This phone was different. The shimmering colors on the screen invited me to keep using it, and everything was buttery smooth. Apps on the main screens were all bright and colorful, making it so easy to engage with.\n\nI started thinking about how things were when I had my old Samsung my battery would die every 3-4 hours. Yet now, with this iPhone, I found myself constantly plugged in. It dawned on me that I didn\u2019t even know screen time existed. On the iPhone, it\u2019s buried somewhere hard to find, almost as if they were hiding it. It looked like something from the 1990s an old graph, nothing like the sleek and beautiful health app graphs they charge for.\n\nThat\u2019s when I began digging deeper into how social media uses behavioral psychology to manipulate us. I learned how they employed thousands of psychologists to make their platforms as addictive as possible. One simple example? The little circles at the end of a story showing who viewed it. Suddenly, you're in the middle of doing something, but you want to check who saw your story. The pressure mounts, especially when you're somewhere expensive like traveling and you feel like you have to post about it. You\u2019re not posting for you; you\u2019re posting to be the mule for your friends who can\u2019t live the life you\u2019re living.\n\nAs someone who got into coding to build the life I wanted, I started noticing how the addiction to these platforms was making everyone else miss out on the real world. On a train, I saw 9 out of 10 people doomscrolling. Kids waking up, stuck on their phones all weekend. It hit me: I hated everything about social media.\n\nI decided the next product I needed to create had to be about data science and AI, combining both passions to create something that could help people regain control of their time. That\u2019s how Blissio.ai was born.\n\nBlissio.ai is a personalized digital wellness tool. It asks simple questions like your age, profession, and hobbies, and based on those, it creates focus sessions tailored specifically for you. We block apps based on what you need, whether for work, your hobbies, or age group. This way, we\u2019re not arbitrarily blocking things, but helping you focus on what matters most.\n\nI\u2019m so excited to share this with you all! How do you manage your screen time? Would love to hear your thoughts below! \ud83d\udc47"

What if we let people connect based on who they are, not just how they look?\nThat's Kindred. We hide photos until after 3 conversations, focusing first on compatibility and communication styles. Our AI-powered matching system analyzes communication patterns and values to connect people who interact in complementary ways - whether you're a thoughtful listener, animated storyteller, or curious questioner.\nWe're currently in development and building our waitlist. Join us if you're tired of superficial swiping and want to try a dating experience where connections form naturally through conversation.\nI'd love your feedback and questions! What aspects of dating apps frustrate you the most? What would make you excited to try Kindred?"

After talking with dozens of founders, I realized most were guessing about their market fit rather than validating with real data.\n\nValid Spark scans Reddit and Quora conversations to find actual customer pain points and validate business ideas with evidence, not hunches. \n\nThe tool analyzes thousands of discussions to:\n\u2705 Identify the most common user problems\n\u2705 Assess market difficulty and competition\n\u2705 Spot gaps that existing solutions miss\n\u2705 Generate comprehensive and organized validation reports\n\nThis is my first major product launch, and I'm excited to get your honest feedback! What platforms would you like to see added? What validation metrics would be most valuable for your projects?\n\nI'm actively developing new features and would love to know what would make this most useful for the Product Hunt community.\n\nThanks for checking out Valid Spark! \ud83d\ude80"

However, instead of empowering their users, most of these modern, high-powered apps cause users to become confused and lost. The average user, especially a new one, has a low attention span, isn't an expert with your app, and doesn't care about it\u2014causing them to click away or leave your app as soon as they can't figure something out. \n\n\u2728 What is Limeblock\n\nA common solution to this problem is a chatbot widget - there's one on ProductHunt too! But Limeblock does something more than just direct users to what they should be doing; Limeblock does that action for them. Whether it be something tedious like writing this post or as simple as changing emails in settings, Limeblock allows users to commit any in-app action, page navigation, or API fetch in just a click using AI-generated schemas to send to your backend endpoints. \n\nThis is the tip of the iceberg. Limeblock has loads of powerful features that you can use for free with our Launch Week Deal. Plus, we're constantly growing and expanding Limeblock to be the best chatbot widget so become an early adopter and help steer Limeblock in the right direction :)\n\n\ud83d\ude80 How to get started\n\nSign up at <a href=\"https://limeblock.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://limeblock.io/</a> for a free account with unlimited endpoints (Launch Week Only!). We recommend you start using Limeblock to replace your chatbot widget or try it out today at zero risk or time to setup (Just 3 lines of code and the easiest UX to flesh out your block).\n\nI've added a free tier and crazy low pricing for the launch week only so be sure to claim it before I come to my senses and remove it \ud83d\ude05\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts, feedback, and questions! \ud83d\ude4f"

And sometimes, my brain just can\u2019t handle it all together - it explodes, giving me a headache.\n\nTo keep track of meeting notes and activities that need my future attention, I started using Google Keep. At some point, it felt overwhelming, so I switched to Notion. But I hit my breakpoint when I had too much to sift through while searching for something important, and Notion\u2019s pricing plans didn\u2019t help either.\n\n\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddfc, \ud835\udddc \ud835\uddf3\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf9\ud835\ude06 \ud835\uddef\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf9\ud835\ude01 \ud835\uddfa\ud835\ude06 \ud835\udde6\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf1 \ud835\uddd5\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb.\n\nA place where I can store notes and organize them exactly the way I want.

You can create Master Threads as major categories for your activities - like Sales &amp; Partnerships, Marketing Team, User Feedback &amp; Insights, etc.\n\nUnder each Master Thread, you can create Daughter Threads to categorize information further. For example, under User Feedback &amp; Insights, I have subcategories like Customizable Dashboard Requested, Early User Feedback, and more.\n\nWithin each Daughter Thread, I add entries. For instance, under the user feedback category \"Request for Mobile App,\" I log all feedback related to that request.\n\nThis architecture not only helps me stay organized but also allows me to chat with my notes using AI. Before a call, I just hit the \u2018Get Synopsis\u2019 button, and it gives me a summary of all relevant entries.\n\nUntil last week, in the application, I was using GPT-3.5 Turbo and Gemini 2.0 for personal AI purposes. And then, I decided to turn this tool into something everyone can use - allowing users to enter their Gemini API Key and unlock AI features."

Specifically,\n\n- Hyper-specialized AI-powered recommendation systems that learn more about you the more you use and chat with Savvy. No more being shown roles you are not qualified for or are not interested in.\n- Automation of the whole hiring process, from matching to outreach to pitching to screening to calendar management. As a hiring manager, all you need to do is chat with Savvy and wait for final interviews with highly qualified and interested to role in.\n\nIf this is a problem you can relate to, if you want to directly help revolutionize the recruitment industry, or if you just want to support us in our journey, please leave a comment, upvote, and share this product!

Think Promptbase, but interactive \u2014 and the tool runs on the spot.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen creators use it for:\n- Logo and infographics generators\n- CV &amp; cover letter writers\n- Branding kits, SEO outlines, YouTube scripts...\n- D&amp;D character art tools\n- Legal clause generators\n\nAnd it supports both text and image generation \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\n\nWould love your feedback, ideas, and support.

My journey started with Grownetics, the first cannabis AI company, where I led my team to millions in sales through grit, late nights, and a passion for breaking new ground. Then came a curveball: I was forced to resign by greedy VCs and a jealous co-founder who incorrectly thought they could succeed without my leadership. Their misjudgment lit a fire in me. I turned that energy into creating Master Growbot, a tool that\u2019s already showing them up by empowering growers in ways they never imagined.\n\nWhy does this matter to you?\nPicture this: a master grower right in your pocket, dishing out real-time, spot-on advice. That\u2019s Master Growbot. With cutting-edge AI, it catches plant problems early, offers tailored tips, and helps you level up your growing game\u2014all while making it fun and stress-free. Whether you\u2019re a seasoned pro or just starting out, it\u2019s your trusty companion for growing smarter and with confidence.\n\nI get it\u2014I\u2019ve been there. I\u2019ve fumbled through the ups and downs of growing, so I built Master Growbot to solve those headaches. And here\u2019s the kicker: you can try it free until April 20, 2025. No catch, just pure support to help you thrive. Let\u2019s shake up cannabis growing together! Got a question or a growing challenge? Drop it in the comments, and let\u2019s tackle it as a community!"

Businesses have so much valuable content - websites, documents, product pages, videos - but most chatbots just ignore it.\n\nWith Neurally, we wanted to create an AI assistant that actually understands your business. You upload your content, and within minutes, you\u2019ve got a chatbot that can answer real questions with real context. No prompt engineering, no technical setup.\n\nWe\u2019re currently live with:\n\t\u2022\tWebsite widget\n\t\u2022\tWhatsApp AI chat integration\n\t\u2022\tSupport for PDFs, sitemaps, text, and more\n\t\u2022\tFull customization of chatbot UI\n\t\u2022\tLive chatbot preview as you build\n\nWould love for you to check it out, and if you have feedback, feature requests, or even harsh truths - I\u2019m here for it all.\n\nThanks for stopping by!\n\nLokesh\nFounder, Neurally"

I'm an alum of the Stanford AI Lab and Y Combinator, and now the CEO of TalkToSales.\n\nToday, I\u2019m proud to announce the launch of TalkToSales, which pioneers a new way people can interact with computers.\n\nTalkToSales adds AI assistants to websites: they can answer visitors' questions, give them live tours of the website or app, and even help them book follow-up calls and buy things right in the conversation.\n\nUnlike traditional websites, which are the same for everyone who visits them, the TalkToSales assistant customizes the conversation and content shown to every visitor, whether the content is dynamic slides, a website/app tour, or both.\n\nTalkToSales also lets the people behind a website offer to \"drop in\" in place of the AI assistant and talk with visitors directly, when visitors accept. Shopkeepers in physical stores have always been able to talk to customers as they browse, but it hasn't been possible to do this on the web until now. We think this could be quite useful for companies that do business online to have more personal engagement with web visitors.\n\nWe think TalkToSales assistants can be helpful for a number of use cases:\n\nSoftware sales: the website itself can become the first sales call, answering visitors' questions, qualifying their good fit and intent, and booking follow-up calls for good leads.\n\nSoftware onboarding and support: Imagine a Clippy that actually worked, talking to you over voice and actually taking actions in a web app for you as you ask it for how to do things.\n\nE-commerce: Imagine having a personal shopper on e.g. the Home Depot website, where a virtual man in an orange apron could show you different dishwasher models and help you pick between them.\n\nReal estate: Imagine going to an apartment building's website and having a virtual real estate agent answer your questions, give you virtual tours of apartments, and book you for a real-world tour.\n\n(Any other ideas? We're all ears!)\n\nWe think TalkToSales assistants can also be very helpful from an analytics point of view - instead of just seeing who visits your page and for how long, imagine being able to see which questions people have, what objections prevent them from engaging deeper, etc. TalkToSales logs transcripts of conversations and the AI can surface patterns from those conversations from you.\n\nPlease try it out and let us know what you think! And if you know anyone else who'd be interested in this, I'd appreciate you sharing it with them."

Airial is the personal travel agent with AI superpowers.

Being avid travelers, we were traveling for several months a year and spending multiple days planning and booking each trip. Hours and hours of research, browsing, watching videos, form-filling, spreadsheets, refinements etc. As we dug deeper, we realized that the scale and the intensity of this problem is stunning - hundreds of millions of trips are booked online every year and planning each of them takes over five hours on average.</p><br><p>Our vision <em>\u201cJust imagine your trip, and Airial it!\u201d</em> stems from our ultimate wish as travelers - AI that can figure out all the intricacies of trip planning for you - hotels, activities, flights, trains, transits, deals, date options, restaurants, interests, research, travel videos and everything else.</p><br><p>Airial is the only travel planner out there today which creates plans crafted to the last detail, like a a travel agent truly would. We pick flights, hotels, transportation and plan every single day of your trip in detail around these choices and your preferences. The defining features that set us apart from competition originate from the core beliefs that Airial is built on:</p><ul><li><p>\ud83d\udcc5 <strong>Detailed intricately crafted plans:</strong> Attention to detail makes trip plans incredible. Airial plans trips in a level of detail that is simply unmatched, taking care of hundreds of common sense constraints across thousands of variables in seconds.</p></li><li><p>\ud83d\ude80 <strong>From Reels to Itineraries:</strong> TikTok / IG reels to Trips is work that millions do manually. We now enable all this in a click. This is the intersection of the two big trends in travel - AI and Socials.</p></li><li><p>\ud83c\udfd6\ufe0f <strong>Personalized Planning:</strong> Travel portals today are one-size-fits-all. We plan trips tailored to your specific interests - architecture tours, scenic hikes or samurai sword fighting lessons!</p></li><li><p>\ud83d\udc46 <strong>Actionable Itineraries:</strong> Just having a chatbot pick out one combination for you isn\u2019t practically useful. Which was the last trip you planned that didn\u2019t need any refinement? Every decision Airial makes for you is changeable via chat or UI controls.</p></li><li><p>\ud83c\udf0e <strong>Discovery in context:</strong> As you plan your trip, Airial gives you the tools to discover incredible ideas and expert advice specific to your itinerary and interests which can be instantly imported into your trip.</p></li></ul><br><p>Vacations are for relaxation.

We\u2019re so excited to bring the next generation of Gyroscope to everyone.\n\nThis version makes our signature trackers even better \u2014 letting people easily track food, places, calories and much more \u2014 and also upgrades our AI coaching system to be about 100x more intelligent than the first version we released a few years ago.\n\nThe most common goal people have when signing up is losing bodyfat, so we\u2019ve optimized the entire experience around that. With the new protocol (and free course), you\u2019ll have everything needed to ensure that the weight loss comes from bodyfat rather than valuable muscle mass. Whether on GLP1 meds where this is essential, or just wanting to lose a few pounds after the holidays, we think this protocol can change the world if everyone follows it.\n\nWe just put the app up in the app store, so give it a try and let us know what you think!\n\nPS: Since this is a common question: The app does require an iPhone right now, the android platform currently isn\u2019t quite polished enough to meet the our quality bar\u2014but hopefully one day in the future that will change"

            "body": "<p><strong>Can AI Make Good Music?</strong><br><br>My answer is an unequivocal yes- and that\u2019s why I co-founded <a href=\"https://flowhop.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Flowhop AI</a>, where we\u2019re using the latest generative tech to create killer lofi hip-hop beats.<br><br>If the words \u201cAI\u201d and \u201chip-hop\u201d in the same sentence are enough to pique your interest, feel free to check it out now. But if you like a good origin story, read on.<br><br><strong>The Blissful Years</strong><br><br>I was fortunate to grow up in a musical household and started playing music at a young age. I stayed active in bands from high school through my thirties.<br><br>Despite my love for music, I realized early on that it wasn\u2019t an ideal way to make a living. For that, I turned to coding.<br><br>The thing about coding is it demands long stretches of uninterrupted screen time. And like many developers, I needed a soundtrack.<br><br>For years, that soundtrack could be just about anything: bebop jazz, thrash metal, gritty hip-hop, hardcore punk\u2014even some country. The genre didn\u2019t matter. I could listen to whatever I liked and still stay focused, productive, and incrementally happier.<br><br><strong>The Turning Point</strong><br><br>Then, a few years ago- though I\u2019m not sure exactly when- something strange happened. <br><br>After a lifetime of voracious and wonderfully promiscuous music consumption, I found I could no longer listen to most music while working. It had become a distraction. Especially hip-hop, with its vivid imagery and clever wordplay, pulled my attention away from the work.<br><br>This was a bummer, to say the least, but it led to my discovery of lofi hip-hop. <br><br>The instrumental, often chilled-out, beats were perfect. It became my go-to music whenever I needed to lock in at the keyboard for a few hours.<br><br><strong>The Problem</strong><br><br>Chances are, some of you are also fans of lofi hip-hop. A quick search on YouTube will confirm its popularity. But after a couple of years listening to the top channels, I started to get bored.<br><br>I heard the same tracks a bit too often, and many of the beats shared a bit too much of the same sound palette.<br><br>I wanted more: more variety, more diversity, and more music that sounded like the golden era of sample-based hip-hop I grew up loving.<br><br><strong>AI Changes the Game</strong><br><br>A few months ago, I started playing around with the new wave of AI music-generation tools. I wasn\u2019t trying to start anything- I was just curious.<br><br>The early results? Pretty incredible.<br><br>Soon I found myself wondering, \"<em>Can this thing make lofi hip-hop?</em>\"<br><br>After more focused experimentation, I got my answer. Not only could it make lofi beats- some of them were <em>really, really good</em>. It could even make tracks that echoed the soulful, sample-heavy vibe of golden-era hip-hop.<br><br>That\u2019s when the lightbulb went off.<br><br><strong>Flowhop AI</strong><br><br>Once the vision became clear, I started generating songs like a madman\u2014and recruited one of my best friends (a fellow musician and technologist) to help polish the results for release.<br><br>At <a href=\"https://flowhop.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Flowhop</a>, we\u2019re building the <strong>biggest and best catalog of lofi hip-hop beats on the planet</strong>- music for focus, study, creativity, and flow.<br><br>Whether you\u2019re coding, cramming, writing, or slaying monsters in your favorite game, we want to be your soundtrack.<br><br>Enjoy!</p>"

We're incredibly excited to share our AI-powered redaction platform with you today!</p><p><br>The journey of Redactable began when I was working as a loan consultant and realized something alarming \u2013 those black boxes I was drawing over my clients' sensitive information weren't actually protecting their data. Anyone with basic technical skills could access what was underneath. This wasn't just a small oversight \u2013 it was a massive privacy and security gap affecting countless professionals handling sensitive documents.</p><p><br>We built Redactable to solve this problem once and for all. Our platform doesn't just visually hide information\u2014it permanently removes sensitive data, including hidden data and metadata that most people don't even know exists. And we've made it 98% faster than traditional tools.</p><p><br>What I'm most proud of is that we're democratizing document redaction. Before Redactable, redaction was incredibly time-consuming or required expensive enterprise solutions. Now, professionals across legal, healthcare, finance, government, and other sectors can protect sensitive information efficiently and reliably \u2013 from any browser, without downloads or complex training.</p><p><br>I'd love to hear your thoughts and answer any questions about Redactable. And if you've ever struggled with document redaction, I'd be curious to learn about your experience! \ud83d\ude80</p>"

However, the access to legal review is time consuming and costly, so majority of the times, we sign agreements and documents based on 'trust'. However, when trust is broken that is where our signed documents do not help us as we did not review them thoroughly. For example, you signed an NDA thinking that you should not talk about any confidential matter, however, you did realise that the NDA stopped you from even taking the name of the company and now they are suing you because you just took their name. Similarly, you signed a consent form for your child's trip but did not realise that you have waived all rights for mishaps happening due to negligence on the part of school.\n\nPersonas is an AI powered tool which uses vectors to analyse each document in detail. The AI generates the levers based on each document type, where the levers are key aspects under which the document needs to be reviewed. The system also seeks your preferences for each aspect so that the system processes based on your expectations. Finally, in under 2 mins you get the entire document reviewed with each aspect marked as Red, Green or Amber based on the severity of the issue. The best part, if you review such documents regularly, like NDAs coming from various customers, vendors etc, you can create a persona with your preferences and every time a new NDA comes, you can get it reviewed based on your persona with a single click of a button.\n\nGive it a try and let me know if you think it would help you in being safe from signing documents with clauses which can be detrimental to you in the long run."

I\u2019m a CS student who loves music and events, and I built Event_Beats to solve a problem I faced\u2014creating playlists that vibe with everyone at parties and late night padel games. It\u2019s been a game-changer for my friends and family, and as a music fan, I can say the AI recommendations are really good and aren\u2019t too mainstream! we use AI to turn guest song requests into Spotify playlists that match the mood. The project is currently available for spotify due to the apple api development  fees and to 25 users for our MVP. Of you have an event this weekend, please try it out, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts."

Add authentication to your app? Implement a new API endpoint? These are perfect Solver tasks.<br></p><br><p>We're especially strong with Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and actively support Go and Rust ecosystems, though we work with many languages.</p><br><p>\ud83e\udd1d WHY WE'RE HERE</p><br><p>We built Solver for developers, but product managers and other team members started using it too.</p><br><p>We're engaging with the Product Hunt community because many of you work across technical and non-technical roles.</p><br><p>Your feedback will directly shape our roadmap as we consider which features to prioritize for different types of users.</p><br><p>\ud83d\ude80 GETTING STARTED</p><br><p>Sign up through our homepage at <a href=\"https://solverai.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://solverai.com</a> or go straight to the app at <a href=\"https://app.solverai.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://app.solverai.com</a>.</p><br><p>We'll be around all day to answer questions and would love to hear your thoughts!</p><br><p>Special thanks to <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/@chrismessina\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@chrismessina</a> for hunting us!</p><br><p>- Mark, Dan, and the Solver team</p>"

With <strong>Needle Knowledge Threader</strong>, we've built a bridge between <strong>discovery and action</strong>.</p><br><p>In a workspace fragmented across Google Drive, Slack, Notion, and Jira, Needle now provides a <strong>unified command center</strong>.

We use an AI to summarize and track activity over time. Zysu allows users to request in plain English what it should say or do. The bot will use its memory and recent activity to interact! Followers can even compete for its attention! We had to build a super efficient system to make our free tier possible, this was a much harder problem than it looks.\n\nWho?\nWe are working to support every social media platform. We listen to our users, and currently have a lot of video game streamers. We support useful features they requested for YouTube, Discord, and Twitch. Anyone can still sign up and try things out!\n\nWhat's Next?\n1) Browser plugin for voice capture during streams\n2) AI bot that can be summoned to chats on Twitch and Discord. YouTube if users demand it.\n3) AI content creator finder chat\n4) AI content creator chat and notification based helper designed to offer real time advice and funding opportunities that don't bother your followers\n\nCan Anyone Ask for Features?\nTotally! We only want to build what people want. Just note that we have to give some priority to our paying customers."

I\u2019m open to feedback and constructive criticism to make it better. I\u2019d love for you to give it a try and let me know what you think.

Navigable AI is a no-code LLM fine-tuning platform that helps you easily build &amp; integrate an intelligent AI assistant into your product. Here\u2019s what the assistant does:</p><ul><li><p>\ud83e\udded AI-Suggested Navigation: Guides users to the most relevant pages in your app using suggestions.</p></li><li><p>\ud83e\udd16 Automate Actions: Lets the AI perform actions on behalf of your users using LLM tool calling, while re-using existing business logic.</p></li><li><p>\ud83d\ude04 Context-Aware Responses: Let's you create fine-tuned models to understand your product and deliver precise answers, using your product documentation.</p></li></ul><p>With our platform and SDKs, building and integrating a fine-tuned assistant that does all of these things is super easy, all while keeping costs low (more than 80% savings)!<br><br><strong>Who\u2019s it for?</strong></p><ul><li><p>Products looking to build an AI Assistant to help users find the right features.</p></li><li><p>Websites needing a simple Q&amp;A bot that answers questions with precision.</p></li><li><p>Freelancers and service providers who want to create and integrate AI chatbots with minimal effort and cost.<br></p></li></ul><p><strong>What's our story?</strong><br>LLMs became popular, but most products can only do so much with LLMs, summaries &amp; simple content generation mainly. We were looking for other use cases when we realized that LLMs are smart enough to guide users, but only if it knows your product inside-out. For this, we decided to go with the LLM fine-tuning approach. With insights from my partners, we built Navigable AI to simplify the LLM fine-tuning process using a no-code approach, taking care of the heavyweight tasks and avoiding common pitfalls. A side-effect benefit of this process was huge reduction in cost. Because we are able to use a smaller LLM for fine-tuning to get good results, we are saving big on the inference costs.<br><br><strong>What do we need?</strong><br>We\u2019re eager for feedback on both our product idea and execution. If you have any suggestions or questions, please drop them here. And if you like what you see, feel free to share it with others! Also, If you need a customized LLM fine-tuning solution, we can make it happen. Just get in touch and we'll help you out.<br><br></p><p>Thanks for checking out Navigable AI. We can\u2019t wait to hear your thoughts! \ud83d\ude80</p>"

Over the next 3 years, my team built bots for hedge funds, influencers, and high-income traders who were all facing the same issue: time, inconsistency, and burnout.\n\nNow we\u2019ve packaged that into Archaide \u2014 an AI agent that lets anyone automate their trading strategy with natural language prompts.

Instead of just focusing on conveying my message, I often spend more time making sure it sounds like it came from an educated adult rather than a 3rd grade kiddo.<br><br>No matter how creative or brilliant an idea is, people can misunderstand or even ignore it if the message doesn't come across well. It's pretty understandable, right? If your writing sounds like a third grader's, people subconsciously judge your intelligence.<br><br>I know there are plenty of products out there that can help with this, but I'm a Slacker -- I mean, a big fan of Slack (not an actual slacker, literally). I love Slack and want a tool that integrates seamlessly with it. I want to improve the experience, type faster, and customize my message tone depending on who I'm chatting with. Sure, you can get a lot of these features for free from ChatGPT or other tools, but constantly switching windows, copying and pasting, and manually prompting every time is a pain. I want to do it quickly with no extra steps. That's why I built this tool\u2014for myself and for others.<br><br>I was a Principal Engineer at a Fortune 500 company that takes customer data security seriously by encrypting everything. Working with encrypted data is a PITA, but after dealing with it for so long, it has become second nature to me. Now, I'm addicted to this pain (yeah, it's contagious). All of our products encrypt customer data before storing it in the database, and we rotate keys regularly.<br><br>You've probably heard companies brag about encrypting data at rest and in transit. That comes out of the box with cloud-managed services\u2014but it doesn't mean their employees can't access your data. I'm not saying they'll do anything shady (but who really knows? ahem... me ta). With our approach, data is encrypted using AES-256 before it even reaches the database, making it virtually impossible for anyone to extract meaningful information.<br><br>One more thing -- this particular product doesn't store your messages permanently. They're encrypted in the cache layer for only a short time before the TTL kicks them out. If you disable the preview feature, we won't even cache them. Your messages will just pass through\u2026 like your ex.</p>"

We thought there was room for something transparent and dev-friendly that just works for most search use cases out of the box. Meilisearch AI is another step in this direction.</p><p><br>Our key features are:</p><p>\ud83d\udd0e  Full-text search with simple, expressive ranking rules</p><p>\ud83e\udde0 AI-powered hybrid, semantic, and multi-modal search</p><p>\u26a1\ufe0f Sub 50ms latency, optimized for end user search</p><br><p>We\u2019re excited to stabilize AI-powered search to allow developers to integrate fast and relevant search, retrieval-augmented generation, and recommendations in their apps. Building upon a year of open-source beta, our managed offer comes with the scalability, security, and monitoring you need to stay focused on building, not managing infrastructure.</p><br><p>For the occasion, we\u2019re offering 2 months of free Meilisearch Cloud subscription. Use the \u2728 \"MeiliAI\" \u2728 coupon to get started.</p><br><p>We can\u2019t wait to hear your thoughts!</p><br><p>For more details on our launch, check out: <a href=\"https://meilisearch.com/launch-week\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://meilisearch.com/launch-week</a></p><br><p>Happy building \ud83d\ude80</p>"

            "body": "\ud83d\udc4b Hey Hunters,\n\nI\u2019m Jasmin, Co-founder of Gemoo. We\u2019re back with something completely new. \n\nToday, we\u2019re introducing Gemoo, an AI-powered video editing tool that makes content creation effortless.\n\n\ud83c\udfac What\u2019s New in the All-New Gemoo?\n\nGemoo eliminates tedious editing by automating subtitles, B-roll, cuts, and effects, allowing you to create polished, high-quality videos in minutes. Here\u2019s how:\n\n- AI-Powered B-Roll Insertion \u2013 Stop searching for stock footage. Gemoo analyzes your video and auto-inserts relevant B-roll to make your content more dynamic.\n\n-  Auto Subtitles &amp; Custom Captions \u2013 No more manual transcription. Gemoo generates accurate subtitles instantly in 100+ languages, complete with customizable templates that fit your brand.\n\n-  Smart Effects &amp; Dynamic Zooms \u2013 Need to emphasize key points? Gemoo automatically adds zoom-ins, motion effects, and trendy visuals to keep your audience engaged.\n\n-  Edit Video by Editing Text \u2013 No timeline needed! Gemoo allows you to edit your videos as easily as a Google Doc. Simply modify or delete text in the transcript to trim the corresponding video segments.\n\n-  Turn Long Videos into Viral Clips \u2013 AI detects key moments in your video and helps you cut them into short, engaging clips\u2014perfect for YouTube Shorts, TikTok, and Instagram Reels.\n\n-  AI Titles, Descriptions &amp; Hashtags \u2013 Let AI generate optimized video titles, descriptions, and hashtags to improve discoverability and engagement across YouTube, TikTok, and more.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Why We Completely Transformed Gemoo\n\nWhen we first launched Gemoo, it was built as a video messaging tool for communication and collaboration. But as we listened to our users and studied the evolving video landscape, we realized something: content creators, marketers, and businesses needed better, faster ways to create compelling videos.\n\nTraditional editing is time-consuming. Searching for B-roll, manually adding captions, cutting clips for different platforms\u2014it all adds up to hours of work. We wanted to remove the friction from the video creation process and let AI handle the heavy lifting.\nSo, instead of just iterating on the old Gemoo, we boldly decided to rebuild it from scratch\u2014with AI-driven video editing at its core.\n\nThe result? A completely new, smarter, and more intuitive Gemoo. One that makes video editing as fast and effortless as possible, without sacrificing creativity.\n\n\ud83d\udcbc Who Is Gemoo For?\n\u2705 Content Creators &amp; YouTubers \u2013 Create high-quality videos faster and focus on growing your audience.\n\u2705 Social Media Marketers \u2013 Boost engagement with polished, AI-enhanced videos optimized for every platform.\n\u2705 Educators &amp; Course Creators \u2013 Turn lectures into engaging lessons with auto-subtitles and perfect B-roll footage.\n\u2705 Businesses &amp; Agencies \u2013 Scale your video production without increasing your editing workload.\n\n\ud83d\udd0d So, What\u2019s Next?\n\nWe\u2019re thrilled to bring the new Gemoo to you today, and we\u2019d love your feedback! \ud83d\udca1\nYou can try Gemoo for free today \u2013 no credit card required. Just upload a video, let AI handle the tedious tasks, and see how much faster and easier video creation can be.\nWe\u2019d love to hear from you! Drop your thoughts, feedback, or questions in the comments. We\u2019re here all day answering questions and taking notes to keep improving. \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Try Gemoo now: <a href=\"https://gemoo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://gemoo.com/</a>\n\n\ud83d\udcb2What\u2019s more?\nWe\u2019ve prepared an exclusive 20% off coupon for the Product Hunters: PH20OFF. Enter it at checkout to unlock full access to Gemoo. \n\nThanks, Product Hunt! We can\u2019t wait to see what you create with Gemoo! \u2764\ufe0f\n\nBest, \n\nJasmin\n\nGemoo Team"

The idea for ChatterKB was born from two real-world challenges I encountered while working with an agency. First, I was asked if there was a way to transform documents\u2014like video transcripts\u2014into a branded, shareable chatbot. Second, the agency couldn\u2019t understand why there wasn\u2019t an affordable solution that enabled their team to quickly find insights during client calls or while drafting emails based on previously created content. This sparked the creation of ChatterKB\u2014a tool that lets you build an interactive, AI-driven repository of ideas and insights, much like an evolving newsletter or your own personal assistant, available in both public and private modes. For the tech-savvy, think of it as a RAG as a Service with reporting and branding.</p><br><p><strong>Two Powerful Solutions in One Platform</strong></p><br><p><strong>For Teams</strong></p><p>\u2022 <strong>Accelerated Analysis:</strong> Upload your documents and chat your way to insights in minutes, not hours.</p><p>\u2022 <strong>Enhanced Collaboration:</strong> Pin key findings, share real-time reports, and keep your team aligned.</p><p>\u2022 <strong>Data-Driven Decisions:</strong> Uncover hidden connections within your documents to empower smarter strategies.</p><br><p><strong>For Creators</strong></p><p>\u2022 <strong>24/7 Engagement:</strong> Convert your content into an interactive hub where your audience can ask questions anytime.</p><p>\u2022 <strong>Custom Branding:</strong> Tailor the look and feel to match your personal or brand style.</p><p>\u2022 <strong>Monetization Options:</strong> Choose from free offerings or premium subscription tiers to even generate revenue from your expertise.</p><br><p><strong>Powerful Features &amp; Integrations</strong></p><p>\u2022 <strong>Seamless Integration:</strong> Import content directly from Notion, Google Drive, and more.</p><p>\u2022 <strong>Advanced AI Models:</strong> Powered by leading models like LLama 3.3 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet, delivering precise and nuanced responses.</p><p>\u2022 <strong>Flexible Pricing:</strong> Start free with up to 30 monthly chats and one knowledge base, or upgrade to the Plus plan at $30/month for more capacity and features.</p><br><p>ChatterKB is all about unlocking and sharing the power of your knowledge\u2014whether it\u2019s for boosting team productivity or engaging your audience in a fresh, interactive way.</p>"

During my tenure as Director of Economic Development for Montana, I witnessed firsthand the challenges that cannabis legalization presented to workplace and public safety, as well as the unfair treatment that cannabis users endured from chemical drug tests. Traditional drug tests cannot distinguish between past use and current impairment, creating a deeply unfair situation for cannabis users. These tests commonly lead to adverse employment action or impaired driving charges for safe and responsible cannabis users as a result. We need a test for actual impairment from cannabis and other drugs and that's what we've built.\n\nGaize is a real-time impairment detection platform that objectively measures current impairment by conducting a series of automated eye tests based on the Drug Recognition Expert process. We conduct tests using a VR headset with embedded eye tracking sensors, then analyze the resulting data using a combination of machine learning and analytical models. The product is over 98% accurate today and getting better all the time. Our goal is to provide businesses and law enforcement with a fair tool that allows them to maintain safety without unjustly affecting those who use cannabis responsibly. \u200bThe product is used today by some of the top safety-sensitive businesses in the US.\n\nI'm eager to hear your thoughts!"

Our software and systems are siloed, data isn't saved or shared, and 90% of it is unstructured\u2014so, generally unusable. In an already complex industry, this lack of organization and clarity not only makes development and operations challenging, but downright risky.</p><br><p>There's millions of data points that need to be collected, organized, verified, analyzed, and utilized. The old school solution was ignoring this problem until you had enough capital to hire analysts and scientists. Now, there's no need for this \"ten-finger\" automation, because artificial intelligence can read, analyze, and predict based on collected data faster than humans\u2014and continuously.</p><br><p><strong>\ud83d\udca0 Introducing Building, Inc</strong></p><br><p>Building answers a few essential questions that real estate stakeholders have had for a while: where can I find this document? Is this data correct? When was this information updated? What do I not know that might pose risk to this project? How do I protect my investment?</p><br><p><em>Our flagship product: The Data Room</em></p><p>Data repositories aren't new, but they're also not smart. Building connects to any server or repository you're currently using to store data and becomes a data layer on-top. This lets you own your data while Building becomes a steward, making information available to your stakeholders or running AI algorithms for extracting key information from your documents. Every document is hashed to the blockchain, create an immutable proof of the document's state.</p><br><p><em>Our unique integration: Tokenization</em></p><p>We believe digital assets are the future and that tokenization is a cutting-edge way to unlock value in traditionally illiquid markets. In order to do this successfully, financial assets need a lot of data. This is where Building comes in: after collecting and verifying property data, Building supports asset appraisal with integrated valuation models\u2014then, that value can be put on-chain in the form of a security token. The best part? It's dynamic and real-time, updating with each new document in the data room. This offers unprecedented transparency and flexibility for those looking to buy, sell, trade, or collateralize their digital assets.</p><br><p><em>Risk analysis and other AI tools</em></p><p>With a plethora of data available through our platform, one can only imagine the hundreds of AI agents that could begin analyzing building codes, design plans, pro-forma, or asset performance. This makes Building a cornerstone for real estate intelligence. What's next, derivative markets?</p><br><p><strong>\u2692\ufe0f Unlock the value of your real estate data</strong></p><br><p>Whether you're a real estate developer or asset manager, if you need to digitize your back-office, automate your workflows, increase transparency for your stakeholders, and want to future-proof your properties with tokenization, Building is your answer\u2014and the only solution in the market of its kind.</p><br><p>Explore <a href=\"https://building.inc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://building.inc</a> and learn how we can save you time and money, plus add value to your assets. Reach out to our team and we'll help you pick the right package for bringing your real estate portfolio into the modern age.</p><br><p>If you aren't a real estate developer or asset manager but still want to see the product in action, we are always looking for strategic partnerships. For example, if you're a lender and want better transparency and risk analysis while underwriting a client, we can white label the product for your needs.</p><br><p>Special thanks to every person who's contributed decades of real estate knowledge to make this platform a reality.</p>"

            "body": "I built an invisible AI tool to help you pass coding interviews. Here's why I had to.\n\nHi, I'm Danny, the creator of Interview Code Ace. Interview Code Ace is an invisible, undetectable AI tool that helps you pass the technical interview. Our desktop application is completely hidden to common streaming and proctoring platforms used in programming interviews such as Hackerrank, CodeSignal, Coderpad, Zoom, even Discord, and more.\n\nI started Interview Code Ace for one reason, to help in the pursuit of finally getting rid of obnoxious 90-120 minute long online assessments and online technical leetcode style interviews. These tests are NOT indicative of a developers true skill. So needless to say, I hope this tool becomes eventually obsolete.\n\nHow and how much?\n- Hidden globally registered commands (hidden from streaming and proctoring sites)\n- Hidden from streaming platforms (specific info about certain platforms in Documentation and in app)\n- Intuitive and easy to remember commands for discreet desktop app interaction\n- Clickthrough mode at the push of one command, allowing to click past the app for stealth\n- Movement commands to keep your eyes on the prize, your eyes never have to leave the main display\n- Problem too big for 1 screen? Multi screenshot covers you allowing for larger problem help\n\n$25 monthly for access to GPT-4o mini or save 67% with base yearly plan for $100\n$50 monthly for access to GPT-4o (Best model) or save 70% with pro  yearly plan for $180\n \n\nWhy do this? The Lore\nI'm a Software Engineer with 5 years of experience. I recently had an interview for a Software Engineer III position at a well known company. The entire interview process took 5 rounds. Yes, 5. 4 of which were technical LeetCode style questions. Now, I'm no master of LeetCode, but I'm also no slouch clocking in about 250+ problems (40-40-20 about split between easy med hard), including the Blind 75 for good measure. I went through all 4 technical interviews and aced each and every problem (according to the different interviewers), I had seen them before.\n\nA few days after my last technical, I got the news\u2026 rejected. 190k base salary position plus bonus all gone. I was shocked. I studied so damn hard for these interviews, only to be told they were moving along with other candidates. Here's the secret though, I got lucky. I got 4 exact problems back to back that I had seen before. I didn't know when the next time I would get such good results in an interview. I've always been a middle of the line developer, but this one hurt.\n\nAfter about a week of getting over the rejection, I just had enough. I do not believe LeetCode should be the industry standard. So I created Interview Code Ace. Am I here to suggest the solution or alternative? No, not at all. I'm here to force it. Give software devs the time of day again. I hope for a day where you get the common courtesy of applying to a job and speaking to a human, and given a genuine opportunity to showcase your skills. We've already been seeing trends towards in person interviews for some companies, and that's when I decided, it's time to put our foot on the gas and make these companies sweat even more.\n\nFinal note, I want to give a lower entry point price for people than compared to other similar applications. Hence, why we offer a few options to help out programmers of all skill levels. You don't need the Turbo Max XD AI 5000 model to pass LeetCode questions. But, we do offer a more powerful option for those needing help with custom problems given to you.\n\nI thank you for reading this and I hope we can create a better interviewing future for software engineers. I wish you all the best in your future technical interviews!\n\nInterviewCodeAce: <a href=\"https://interview-code-ace.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://interview-code-ace.com</a>\n\nDanny"

I'm thrilled to share our journey with you today!\n\n\ud83c\udf31 The Origin Story:\nAccord was born from a real problem I faced throughout my engineering career. Early on, I worked at a company with a complex real-time auction engine where I experienced exponential growth thanks to their well-documented Architecture Decision Records (ADRs). This practice of documenting not just WHAT decisions were made, but WHY they were made became my engineering philosophy.\n\nAs I moved into leadership roles, I implemented ADRs at every company I joined, with remarkable results: faster onboarding, more thoughtful discussions, and clearer technical direction. But the tools we used (Confluence, GitHub, Asana) were never quite right for the job.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 The Lightbulb Moment:\nWhen LLMs became publicly available, I immediately saw the opportunity to create something transformative - a dedicated platform for technical decision-making with AI assistance.\n\n\u2728 What Makes Accord Different:\n- AI-powered guidance that helps teams create better ADRs\n- Real-time collaboration for faster consensus\n- Centralized repository that preserves institutional knowledge\n- A structured approach that bridges technical and non-technical stakeholders\n\nI'd love to hear from you! Have you used ADRs in your organization? What tools do you currently use for technical decision-making? What challenges do you face when documenting architectural decisions?\n\nLooking forward to your feedback and questions! \ud83d\ude80"

Each one was a separate tab, login, and vibe \u2014 but I wanted a unified, clean interface that just worked.\n\nSo I built it. For myself at first. Then for friends. Now it\u2019s ready for you.\n\n\u2728 What PantherAI does:\n\t\u2022\tSwitch between multiple AI models instantly (GPT-4o, o3-mini, Claude 3.7 sonnet, Gemini, Grok 2, Deepseek r1... and lots more coming soon).\n\n\t\u2022\tUse each model for their unique abilities\n\t\u2022\tCompare outputs, tones, styles, or reasoning across LLMs\n\t\u2022\tUse it as a playground for thinking, building, or brainstorming\n\nJust visit the site and go:\n\ud83d\udc49 <a href=\"https://pantherai-irol.onrender.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://pantherai-irol.onrender.com</a>  (yes i'll buy a proper domain soon lol)\n\nI\u2019m still building it in public \u2014 feedback, ideas, feature requests, or even \u201cthis sucks\u201d messages are all welcome.
