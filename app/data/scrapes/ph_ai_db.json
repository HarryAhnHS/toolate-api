Sure, you could just tell them to read the prompt and fill our the bits they need, but we all know nobody reads on the internet! \n\nSo, I created this simple free tool which lets you drop in a prompt and set up what info people need to add. You can set the type of each field so you can ask for numbers, long/short text or even a selection from a dropdown.\n\nAnyone you share the link with can then easily enter the required data and get their own version of the prompt to copy and paste. Meaning more consistent results and hopefully fewer questions on what they need to do!"

Or sometimes, they'd just translate the idiom into something equivalent in the target language. Thus losing the color of the original phrasing.  This is terrible for language learners.\n\nSeeing this actually inspired me to build something specifically to help with that problem: BestFuckingTranslator.com. The goal is to provide translations that capture the meaning and nuance of idiomatic expressions, in addition to the literal words. Both of those things are important for language learners. \n \n\nHere an of example of how it handles things differently:\n\nEnglish to Spanish:\n\nPhrase: \"You need to bite the bullet and tell him.\"\n\nGoogle Translate: \"Tienes que agarrar la bala y decirle.\" (Doesn't make sense in Spanish)\n\nBestFingTranslator: \"Tienes que morder la bala y dec\u00edrselo. (Necesitas enfrentarte a la situaci\u00f3n y hablar con \u00e9l.)\"\n\nSource text can be in basically any language in the world. The AI does a good job of detecting it. For target language, currently 60+ languages are supported. If you find your language missing, please let me know, I'll add it."

If you're building AI apps or features, you can use this to monitor your LLM calls for cost, usage, and performance issues.\n\nThe project includes a Tinybird backend to store and process LLM call events, and a Next app frontend to visualize critical LLM metrics such as cost by model, TTFT, total requests/tokens used, etc. All of the visualizations can be filtered and drilled down by a bunch of different dimensions.\n\nWe designed this to be used as is: you can deploy it to Vercel/Tinybird for free and instrument your app to start sending LLM calls (you can find examples for LiteLLM and Vercel AI SDK in the repo).\n\nThe app also includes a template for adding multi-tenancy via Clerk. This can be useful if you'd like to modify the components and integrate them into your app to give your users visibility over their LLM usage in your application.\n\nWe'd love to hear your feedback and how you might use/extend this. Of course, it's open source, and PRs are welcome!\n\nIf you have any questions, the Tinybird Slack community has answers :)"

The idea was born from my own frustrations as an AI engineer trying to manage prompt development across multiple projects.\n\nI found myself constantly switching between text editors, Jupyter notebooks, and various testing scripts - with no consistent way to track versions, measure performance, or seamlessly deploy to production. My team was also struggling with knowledge sharing and standardization.\n\nAfter talking with dozens of AI developers, I realized this wasn't just my problem - the entire industry is lacking proper tooling for prompt engineering, despite it becoming a crucial skill.\n\nThat's why we built KitchenAI as a complete studio that brings together experimentation, testing, metrics, and deployment in one sleek developer experience.\n\nI'd love to hear from other AI developers and product teams:\n- What's your current workflow for prompt engineering?\n- Which part of the process causes the most headaches?\n- What features would make your prompt development process 10x better?\n\nJoin our waitlist to get early access and help shape the future of professional prompt engineering!"

You know the drill: someone suggests a date, three people are unavailable, someone forgot the timezone, another replies late, and suddenly\u2026 the event never happens.\n\nQuickPoll solves that in seconds.\n\nYou just describe your event in plain English/French/Spanish \u2014 like \u201cTeam meeting next week, Monday at 10am or Wednesday at 2pm\u201d \u2014 and the AI does the heavy lifting:\n\u2192 It extracts the possible dates and times\n\u2192 Creates a clean, shareable poll\n\u2192 No signup required for you or participants\n\u2192 You get email notifications when people vote\n\u2192 And yes, you can add a password if you want to keep it private\n\nWhy does it matter?\nBecause the alternatives (like Doodle or When2Meet) still require a lot of clicking, form filling, and account creation. QuickPoll strips all that away. It\u2019s fast, intuitive, and focused on doing one thing really well: helping people agree on a date, fast.\n\nIt\u2019s completely free, and you don\u2019t need to create an account to use it.\n\nI\u2019d love your feedback, ideas, and maybe even a little upvote if you think QuickPoll can help others like it helped me. \ud83d\ude4c\n\nThanks for checking it out!"

I'm Zach, and here's my story\u2026<br><br>About a year ago I started building custom AI chatbots for businesses\u2014everyone from authors to e-commerce stores, insurance brokers, hospitality teams, even observatories were interested. But I kept running into the same problem:<br>Manually gathering data, embedding it, setting up RAG pipelines, and writing prompt logic over and adjusting it until they clients where happy was very tedious. The clients and I would meet for a hour or so, then I would code the prompts, then we would iterate on this process until they were happy. I thought there had to be a better way so we could do the part both I and the business owners enjoyed doing during our meeting which was training the assistants.<br><br>Eventually, I thought:<br>\u201cWhat if business owners could just train and customize their own ai chatbot\u2014without needing me to code it for them every time? Or what if we could manage it for them so we can quickly train them together in our meetings so they can have them deployed to their customers faster? (also less work for me lol)\u201d<br><br>That sparked everything.<br>The first problem was what was the best way to input the business information that was the least amount of work. For the majority of clients uploading documents and using RAG was easy enough. But then other business owners didn't want to do that much work and requested an easier way. I checked out other solutions that used a UI you can drag &amp; drop lines to different knowledge bases but I knew business owners would loose focus quickly. The second option was let them just add their url and the app would gather business information for them. This seemed to be the fastest way for them to create an ai chatbot and it was the most requested feedback, so I began creating an ai agent that would go out, scrape the data, return it. But this led to a problem where there was too much unnecessary data being scraped (as well as huge context windows for the LLMs) so I had to create another agent that could continuously look at the data coming in, organize it, and them re-organize it at the end to an official knowledge source that was useable by the businesses customer service chatbots. <br><br>So after iterating on the feedback now it's pretty much an ai studio that's a dashboard for designing and training customer service agents. It's general purpose since I currently using the app to solve my own problem by managing clients in various industries chatbots, but feel free to use it for your use case. <br><br>That\u2019s how SmarterChatbots.com was born.<br><br>Now you can: \u2705 Auto-train a chatbot from your website or documents<br>\u2705 Customize the look, tone, and behavior<br>\u2705 Embed it anywhere or share via QR code<br>\u2705 Go live in under 10 minutes<br><br>I\u2019ll admit, I was nervous to hit \u201claunch\u201d here\u2014Product Hunt is full of amazing products, and things might still break \ud83d\ude05\u2014but this is my shot. I\u2019d love for you to give it a try.<br><br>Some fun chatbot ideas people have created on our platform: <br>\u2705 An author of children's books trained various characters on the books and added the QR code to the end of her book so kids could interact and play a game with the characters. Each character was context aware of who they were and where they were in the story. <br>\u2705 My friend who owns a mobile auto mechanic business created one to diagnose preliminary auto issues and help him estimate pricing. <br>\u2705 A few businesses in the hospitality industry created chatbots trained to engage in customers to answer questions about what the experience is like, ticket pricing, menu &amp; drink options and events that where hidden on their website.  <br><br>\ud83d\udcac Feedback, feature requests, or even \u201cthis part was confusing\u201d messages are all welcome.<br>This indie project is all about learning how to make training and deploying AI chatbots truly effortless.<br><br>Thanks for being here \ud83d\ude4f<br>\u2014 Zach</p>"

            "body": "Hey Product Hunt! \ud83d\udc4b\n\n    Super excited to share the Ithena SDK (@ithena-one/mcp-governance) today!\n\n    We're seeing the Model Context Protocol (MCP) unlock amazing potential, letting AI models interact with everything from local filesystems and apps to complex enterprise systems. It's incredibly powerful!\n\n    But here's the challenge: moving those cool MCP integrations from a local setup to a secure, shared production or enterprise environment brings a whole new set of critical requirements. Suddenly, you need robust answers to:\n\n        Who is really making this request in a multi-user system? (AuthN)\n\n        Are they authorized to use this specific tool or access that sensitive data? (RBAC)\n\n        How do we securely manage and inject API keys for shared services without scattering secrets? (Credentials)\n\n        How do we get reliable audit logs for security monitoring and compliance? (Auditing)\n\n    Implementing this essential governance layer consistently across every MCP tool is complex, repetitive, and easy to get wrong.\n\n    That's why I built the Ithena SDK! It's an open-source (Apache-2.0) TypeScript library designed specifically to provide this missing enterprise-grade governance layer for your MCP servers.\n\n    Ithena gives you a pluggable pipeline to easily add Identity, RBAC, Credential Management, and Auditing capabilities, letting your team focus on building great MCP features, knowing the security and compliance aspects are handled consistently.\n\n    While you could use parts of it locally, its real power is unlocked when deploying MCP services where security, compliance, and observability are non-negotiable.\n\n    We also have a waitlist open for an optional Managed Platform if you want hosted, production-ready backends for these interfaces later.\n\n    Dive into the GitHub repo and docs to see how it works!\n\n    Curious to hear: How are you tackling security and governance when taking MCP tools beyond local experiments and into shared or production environments? What are the biggest hurdles you've faced?\n\n    Cheers!"

And the ones I have checked - chats are saved unencrypted to disk by default! While some of them now supports remote models, I wanted a more simplified and efficient UI for switching AI models and providers.<br><br>With providers like DeepInfra.com / Together.ai with Nvidia H100 GPU's that can run high parameter / mixture of expert models like DeepSeek, and that chat logging is often off by default with developer accounts, this gave me the idea that I don't need run expensive servers with GPUs to get privacy, as long as the client is secure as well. <br><br>I have built pre-configured Profiles for GPT-4o, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, and Grok with a 'one-click' setup using your own API keys. In fact, it supports any remote or local LLMs (e.g. Ollama) as long as the model interaction is via OpenAI API Compatible spec. <br><br>The app is free to trial for 7 days, and just a one off $12 if you decide to keep it (lifetime of upgrades). It is certified by the Windows Store for your piece of mind.<br><br>So who is this for? Someone who wants to chat with advanced LLM models remotely, and want to minimize exposure to data breach events and (default) information harvesting practices if you were to use the public web models. Or just want to switch between AI models really fast in a single chat thread. <br><br>Would love your feedback, questions or launch support! AMA!</p>"

            "body": "Hey PH community!\n\nToday, we\u2019re launching DGi after months of hunkering down and pair programming with my CTO. Our journey over the past seven years has been full of ups and downs: we scaled a martech company to around 160 people, but when COVID hit, we couldn\u2019t fully bounce back. Our team dissolved, and only my CTO stayed on to keep searching for product-market fit with almost no resources.\n\nDespite it all, we built a pretty cool data workflow product used by several Fortune 500 companies. It felt too cumbersome and time consuming\u2014but it made us profitable. We took that lesson and poured our learnings into our next big bet.\n\nRather than seeing the past as failure, we saw it as proof that every struggle, every pivot, and every lesson would lead us here, stronger than ever.\n\nWhat is DGi?\nSimply put, DGi is an AI agent specialized in data that builds and it is entirely built by AI. It isn\u2019t locked into any fixed front or back end. At its core, it embodies \u201cvisual empathy\u201d: we give you a sleek interface for adding credentials, so you\u2019re not wrangling config files. We let you interact visually, not just via chat. And, of course, we deliver dashboards that are both appealing and easy to navigate.\nWe built DGi using Next.js and Shadcn components because we admire Guillermo\u2019s (Founder of Vercel) philosophy and wanted to bring that same level of tasteful design into the data space.\n\nIn a nutshell with DGi you can:\nConnect to your data or upload files\nCreate dashboards or ask questions about your data\nRun code\nSchedule tasks to orchestrate (just like Airflow)\nIn essence we are a combination between ChatGPT, v0 and Airflow.\nMore on DGi at <a href=\"http://www.dgintel.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">www.dgintel.ai</a>\n\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\nWe believe data exploration should be AI-based from the start. Eventually, tools like Excel and Power BI may fade away if a single product can handle everything\u2014uploading a CSV, connecting a database, creating dashboards, asking questions, and automating workflows. That\u2019s our dream, and DGi is the first step toward making it real.\n\nWe hope you love it as much as we do. You can try it now, for free.\n\nPlus here\u2019s our commitment, if you try it out and you find a bug or want a feature we don\u2019t have, we will fix it or implement it right away.  We know there\u2019s many things to improve. For example we want to update users while DGi is \u201cThinking\u201d. We will bring streaming very soon.\n\nAlso, share what you built with the hashtag #dgi and tag us @datagran on X by April 15 for a chance to win $1,000. The most impressive implementation takes it.\n\nFinally we\u2019ve raised more than $5m thus far but we are opening a community round on Wefunder to give anyone the chance to invest in the future of data <a href=\"https://wefunder.com/datagran\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://wefunder.com/datagran</a>"

You can use the free plan with smaller codebases, and you can upgrade to the bigger ones accordingly.\n\nIf you believe there's something SeniorAI could help you achieve in your development process, let us know at <a href=\"mailto:hello@seniorai.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">hello@seniorai.ai</a>, or on Linkedin at: <a href=\"https://linkedin.com/company/senior-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://linkedin.com/company/sen...</a> \n\nWould love any advice and feedback, and if you have a startup and would like to hop on a call to discuss about your engineering pain points, let us know.\n\nPS: I will announce the latests updates on X as well: <a href=\"https://x.com/sash20m\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://x.com/sash20m</a> .

One potential challenge with that is that I might want to add team members who are not in the support team but occasionally need to assist on some tickets (i.e. engineering team lets say).

One thing that frustrated us was how medical data comes in all these weird formats. So we made sure QuackRead can handle pretty much anything you throw at it - ISOs, PDFs, ZIPs, and even DICOM files. \n\nTo be clear - QuackRead is purely an educational tool. It's not for medical diagnosis. We designed it to satisfy users' curiosity about what AI systems might observe in their medical data. Consider it as an additional perspective that can help you better understand medical information, but always defer to healthcare professionals for actual medical advice.\n\nPlease let us know what you think!"

This app lets you see answers from five of the best AI companies, summarizes their answers for you, and provides a summary table. This process allows you to easily spot hallucinations in certain AI models and companies. And lets you make better decisions. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/qu8FTyaLc9k\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Demo</a>.</p><br><p>There is Debater that can debate any topic. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/JZzebg9gNt4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Demo</a>.</p><p><br>Then the app has a list of interesting questions to get you started with (think Quora). <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/eJlbhXwZkTQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Demo</a>.</p><br><p>There is also a social network where users can post questions and follow each other (think Twitter). <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/rtTdWHrBUPA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Demo</a>.</p><p><br>In addition to this, it has several interesting councils (groups of AI assistants) that give you perspectives from \"across the aisle\".

My resume was completely ignored by recruiters.<br><br>I got really frustrated by the thought of how different my chances would be if recruiters could actually see my projects instead of just reading about them.<br><br>So I built a simple tool to transform my plain text resume into something that showcased my actual work. Some positive feedback from friends in similar situations, and a few rabbit holes later, Profolio was born.<br><br>It's currently in beta with a free tier that lets anyone try the AI enhancements. While it's still evolving, I've got a roadmap of features that will make it even more powerful for job seekers.<br><br>If you've ever been overlooked because your resume couldn't capture what you can actually do, I'd love for you to try it out.

It started after the birth of my second daughter, Athena, when I was trying to find a way to effectively remember all the hacks and insights I learned each day. I needed a system that both kept me organized with as little work possible, but more importantly, one that reminded me of the information when I needed it. </p><br><p>Yes, I tried my phone's note-taking app (along with some others). We can all agree that the note-taking apps out there are messy, overly complicated, and cannot make the data actionable. There was no way they would help me remember to order a different meal next time I come back to this restaurant.\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f</p><br><p>So I decided to build an all-in-one solution...an app that functions like a second brain. </p><br><p>MYNDIFY has:</p><p>\u2705 A pre-built infrastructure to organize your mental notes. Entries are connected as they are created so I don't have to spend time \"making folders\". </p><p>     EG: my \"don't order this meal again\" entry will be tied to the Bob's Bistro record it pertains to (along with other entries like \"there's better parking in the back\" or \"remember you have a coupon\")</p><p>\u2705 Features allowing for each entry to become actionable. So when I go back to Bob's Bistro, MYNDIFY can remind me (automatically) not to order that meal again. </p><p>\u2705 AI generated answers to our questions. With MYNDIFY's Inky chatbot, you can get answers to questions like \"What was the name of the place I took the kids apple picking?\" or \"Which of my friends is vegan?\". </p><br><p>These are just some of the many features MYNDIFY has!</p><br><p>I, along with some of the other early adopters, are obsessed with how useful it is. I absolutely LOVE getting reminders like what to ask the doctor about during our pediatric visits. What about you? How useful is your notes app? What would you love to get reminders for?</p><br>"

While integrating LLMs into my work projects, I kept running into the same issue \u2014 tracking LLM usage and costs for each user. Every time, I had to build a custom solution from scratch.\n\nSo, I built an <a href=\"https://affordai.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Afford AI</a>, a simple analytics tool to handle it.\n\nHow it works?\n1) Add your app &amp; choose an LLM model;\n2) Get an API token;\n3) Send LLM usage events into our API.\n\nThe dashboard shows token consumption, costs, and top users. Pay-as-you-go, no subscriptions, and free usage available. \n\nHappy to be in touch with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyrylo-alokhin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">LinkedIn</a>\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your feedback and ideas for improvement!"

The SDK also allows combining these AI-driven commands with custom Python code, API calls, or direct Playwright manipulation for more control.\n\nKey aspects:\n\n\ud83e\udd16 Powers Browser Agents: The underlying AI model for web automation.\n\u2705 Focus on Reliability: Designed for accurate execution of individual web interaction steps (claims &gt;90% on internal tests).\n\ud83d\udcbb SDK for Developers: The primary way to build with Nova Act right now, offering fine-grained control.\n\ud83d\udcca Strong Benchmarks: Amazon reports strong performance on UI interaction benchmarks like ScreenSpot and GroundUI Web.\n\ud83d\udd2c Research Preview: This is an early release for experimentation.\n\nAmazon sees this focus on reliable building blocks as key for future agent capabilities."

            "body": "<p>\ud83d\udc4b Hey Product Hunt!<br></p><p>I\u2019m the founder of Surfly, where we\u2019ve been building co-browsing technology since 2012. Over the last decade, we\u2019ve helped companies enable real-time collaboration on the web. As part of co-browsing, you need to be able to share any web session. To do that, we built a technology that can <em>take any existing web application and turn it into a virtual session</em> \u2014 one that\u2019s shareable, customizable, and collaborative. That underlying capability ended up being our biggest breakthrough.<br></p><br><p><strong>Why we\u2019re launching Webfuse</strong></p><br><p>Over the years, we\u2019ve seen a few of our most creative customers build <em>incredible</em> tools on top of our tech. They used it to translate legacy applications in real time, sandbox existing web application for privacy, inject new UI into legacy tools, and even power AI-driven assistants that run inside existing web apps.</p><br><p>We always wanted to explore this potential further \u2014 but we weren\u2019t ready. the technology wasn\u2019t mature enough to open up broadly. So we focused on a small group of customers, iterated quietly\u2026 and now, we\u2019re finally ready to share what we\u2019ve built with the world. Introducing <em>Webfuse</em> \u2014 world's first <em>Web Augmentation Platform</em>.</p><p><br><br></p><p><strong>Why nobody else has done this</strong></p><br><p>Until now, your options for modifying existing web apps were limited to:</p><ul><li><p>\ud83d\udd0c <em>Browser extensions</em> (local, requires installation)</p><ul><li><p>eg: <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/plasmo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@Plasmo</a> <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/extensionpay\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@ExtensionPay</a> <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/chatgpt-sidebar-chrome-extension\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@Sider: AI Research Agent &amp; Extension</a> <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/keepitcloaked\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@Cloaked</a> <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/merlin-chatgpt-powered-browser-cmd-g\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@Merlin - ChatGPT powered chrome extension (Cmd+M)</a> <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/frase\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@Frase</a> <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/monica-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@Monica</a> <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/subtly\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@Subtly</a> <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/factory-confirm-by-sourcify\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@Factory Confirm by Sourcify</a> , ...</p></li></ul></li><li><p>\ud83c\udf10 <em>Remote browsers</em> (lower quality as you are streaming pixels)</p></li><li><p>\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f <em>CDN/Edge code injection</em> (requires infrastructure control)</p></li></ul><p>But Webfuse is different. We rewrite the application in real-time and run it in a controlled environment \u2014 one where we can change, monitor, and extend it as needed. It\u2019s a technically complex problem, especially with how fast the web evolves \u2014 but after 10+ years of experience building in this space, we\u2019ve finally cracked it.</p><p><br><br></p><p><strong>How it works</strong></p><br><p>Webfuse wraps any existing web application in a thin virtualization layer \u2014 a \u201cvirtual session\u201d \u2014 where everything can be customized without touching the original source. Once you sign up, you can create a <em>SPACE</em>, which is essentially a smart, shareable link that opens a set of virtualized web apps. From there, you can:</p><ul><li><p>Modify the UI</p></li><li><p>Add security/authentication</p></li><li><p>Inject automation</p></li><li><p>Record &amp; monitor sessions</p></li><li><p>Share with others (like multiplayer mode for any app)</p></li></ul><p>All without needing source code access.</p><p><br><br></p><p><strong>Features</strong></p><ul><li><p>\ud83d\udd10 <em>Security Layers</em> \u2013 Add auth, HTTP-only cookie isolation, audit logs</p></li><li><p>\ud83d\udcf9 <em>Session Recording</em> \u2013 Full video streams of interactions</p></li><li><p>\ud83d\udcc8 <em>Monitoring &amp; Logs</em> \u2013 Real-time JSON-based session audit trail</p></li><li><p>\ud83e\udd16 <em>Automation</em> \u2013 Remote control API for bots and agents</p></li><li><p>\ud83e\udd1d <em>Collaboration</em> \u2013 Share sessions with multiple users in real-time</p></li><li><p>\ud83c\udfa5 <em>Video Chat</em> \u2013 Add video calls to <em>any</em> web app</p></li><li><p>\ud83e\udde9 <em>Custom Extensions</em> \u2013 Build and inject your own logic using a browser-extension-like API<br><br></p></li></ul><p><strong>Why Webfuse is unique</strong></p><br><p>Webfuse enables a new category: Web Augmentation. Instead of building a new app from scratch or waiting for vendors to release features, you can build on top of what already exists \u2014 instantly. You can even turn browser extensions into managed SaaS tools without client-side installs. Whether you're a developer, founder, automator, or hacker \u2014 this is your canvas to remix the web.</p><p><br><br></p><p><strong>Our roadmap</strong></p><p>We\u2019re just getting started. Right now, Webfuse supports the basics of the browser extension API. Based on your feedback, we\u2019ll expand the capabilities, improve performance, and build a full ecosystem around this idea \u2014 including:</p><ul><li><p>Extension marketplace</p></li><li><p>No-code UI builder</p></li><li><p>AI assistants integration</p></li><li><p>Private cloud deployment<br></p></li></ul><p><strong>Join us early \u2014 let\u2019s build together</strong></p><br><p>We\u2019re offering <strong>$100 in credits </strong>for Product Hunt users.

            "body": "9 months ago, I quit my 6-year role at a startup. I felt lost and didn\u2019t know what I was going to do with my life. One evening, I realized I had no time left in my day anymore, and something had changed. I was holding my iPhone 15 Pro Max, and I couldn\u2019t understand why I was spending so much more time on it compared to my old slow Android phone. This phone was different. The shimmering colors on the screen invited me to keep using it, and everything was buttery smooth. Apps on the main screens were all bright and colorful, making it so easy to engage with.\n\nI started thinking about how things were when I had my old Samsung my battery would die every 3-4 hours. Yet now, with this iPhone, I found myself constantly plugged in. It dawned on me that I didn\u2019t even know screen time existed. On the iPhone, it\u2019s buried somewhere hard to find, almost as if they were hiding it. It looked like something from the 1990s an old graph, nothing like the sleek and beautiful health app graphs they charge for.\n\nThat\u2019s when I began digging deeper into how social media uses behavioral psychology to manipulate us. I learned how they employed thousands of psychologists to make their platforms as addictive as possible. One simple example? The little circles at the end of a story showing who viewed it. Suddenly, you're in the middle of doing something, but you want to check who saw your story. The pressure mounts, especially when you're somewhere expensive like traveling and you feel like you have to post about it. You\u2019re not posting for you; you\u2019re posting to be the mule for your friends who can\u2019t live the life you\u2019re living.\n\nAs someone who got into coding to build the life I wanted, I started noticing how the addiction to these platforms was making everyone else miss out on the real world. On a train, I saw 9 out of 10 people doomscrolling. Kids waking up, stuck on their phones all weekend. It hit me: I hated everything about social media.\n\nI decided the next product I needed to create had to be about data science and AI, combining both passions to create something that could help people regain control of their time. That\u2019s how Blissio.ai was born.\n\nBlissio.ai is a personalized digital wellness tool. It asks simple questions like your age, profession, and hobbies, and based on those, it creates focus sessions tailored specifically for you. We block apps based on what you need, whether for work, your hobbies, or age group. This way, we\u2019re not arbitrarily blocking things, but helping you focus on what matters most.\n\nI\u2019m so excited to share this with you all! How do you manage your screen time? Would love to hear your thoughts below! \ud83d\udc47"

What if we let people connect based on who they are, not just how they look?\nThat's Kindred. We hide photos until after 3 conversations, focusing first on compatibility and communication styles. Our AI-powered matching system analyzes communication patterns and values to connect people who interact in complementary ways - whether you're a thoughtful listener, animated storyteller, or curious questioner.\nWe're currently in development and building our waitlist. Join us if you're tired of superficial swiping and want to try a dating experience where connections form naturally through conversation.\nI'd love your feedback and questions! What aspects of dating apps frustrate you the most? What would make you excited to try Kindred?"

After talking with dozens of founders, I realized most were guessing about their market fit rather than validating with real data.\n\nValid Spark scans Reddit and Quora conversations to find actual customer pain points and validate business ideas with evidence, not hunches. \n\nThe tool analyzes thousands of discussions to:\n\u2705 Identify the most common user problems\n\u2705 Assess market difficulty and competition\n\u2705 Spot gaps that existing solutions miss\n\u2705 Generate comprehensive and organized validation reports\n\nThis is my first major product launch, and I'm excited to get your honest feedback! What platforms would you like to see added? What validation metrics would be most valuable for your projects?\n\nI'm actively developing new features and would love to know what would make this most useful for the Product Hunt community.\n\nThanks for checking out Valid Spark! \ud83d\ude80"

However, instead of empowering their users, most of these modern, high-powered apps cause users to become confused and lost. The average user, especially a new one, has a low attention span, isn't an expert with your app, and doesn't care about it\u2014causing them to click away or leave your app as soon as they can't figure something out. \n\n\u2728 What is Limeblock\n\nA common solution to this problem is a chatbot widget - there's one on ProductHunt too! But Limeblock does something more than just direct users to what they should be doing; Limeblock does that action for them. Whether it be something tedious like writing this post or as simple as changing emails in settings, Limeblock allows users to commit any in-app action, page navigation, or API fetch in just a click using AI-generated schemas to send to your backend endpoints. \n\nThis is the tip of the iceberg. Limeblock has loads of powerful features that you can use for free with our Launch Week Deal. Plus, we're constantly growing and expanding Limeblock to be the best chatbot widget so become an early adopter and help steer Limeblock in the right direction :)\n\n\ud83d\ude80 How to get started\n\nSign up at <a href=\"https://limeblock.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://limeblock.io/</a> for a free account with unlimited endpoints (Launch Week Only!). We recommend you start using Limeblock to replace your chatbot widget or try it out today at zero risk or time to setup (Just 3 lines of code and the easiest UX to flesh out your block).\n\nI've added a free tier and crazy low pricing for the launch week only so be sure to claim it before I come to my senses and remove it \ud83d\ude05\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts, feedback, and questions! \ud83d\ude4f"

And sometimes, my brain just can\u2019t handle it all together - it explodes, giving me a headache.\n\nTo keep track of meeting notes and activities that need my future attention, I started using Google Keep. At some point, it felt overwhelming, so I switched to Notion. But I hit my breakpoint when I had too much to sift through while searching for something important, and Notion\u2019s pricing plans didn\u2019t help either.\n\n\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddfc, \ud835\udddc \ud835\uddf3\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf9\ud835\ude06 \ud835\uddef\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf9\ud835\ude01 \ud835\uddfa\ud835\ude06 \ud835\udde6\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf1 \ud835\uddd5\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb.\n\nA place where I can store notes and organize them exactly the way I want.

You can create Master Threads as major categories for your activities - like Sales &amp; Partnerships, Marketing Team, User Feedback &amp; Insights, etc.\n\nUnder each Master Thread, you can create Daughter Threads to categorize information further. For example, under User Feedback &amp; Insights, I have subcategories like Customizable Dashboard Requested, Early User Feedback, and more.\n\nWithin each Daughter Thread, I add entries. For instance, under the user feedback category \"Request for Mobile App,\" I log all feedback related to that request.\n\nThis architecture not only helps me stay organized but also allows me to chat with my notes using AI. Before a call, I just hit the \u2018Get Synopsis\u2019 button, and it gives me a summary of all relevant entries.\n\nUntil last week, in the application, I was using GPT-3.5 Turbo and Gemini 2.0 for personal AI purposes. And then, I decided to turn this tool into something everyone can use - allowing users to enter their Gemini API Key and unlock AI features."

Specifically,\n\n- Hyper-specialized AI-powered recommendation systems that learn more about you the more you use and chat with Savvy. No more being shown roles you are not qualified for or are not interested in.\n- Automation of the whole hiring process, from matching to outreach to pitching to screening to calendar management. As a hiring manager, all you need to do is chat with Savvy and wait for final interviews with highly qualified and interested to role in.\n\nIf this is a problem you can relate to, if you want to directly help revolutionize the recruitment industry, or if you just want to support us in our journey, please leave a comment, upvote, and share this product!

Think Promptbase, but interactive \u2014 and the tool runs on the spot.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen creators use it for:\n- Logo and infographics generators\n- CV &amp; cover letter writers\n- Branding kits, SEO outlines, YouTube scripts...\n- D&amp;D character art tools\n- Legal clause generators\n\nAnd it supports both text and image generation \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\n\nWould love your feedback, ideas, and support.

My journey started with Grownetics, the first cannabis AI company, where I led my team to millions in sales through grit, late nights, and a passion for breaking new ground. Then came a curveball: I was forced to resign by greedy VCs and a jealous co-founder who incorrectly thought they could succeed without my leadership. Their misjudgment lit a fire in me. I turned that energy into creating Master Growbot, a tool that\u2019s already showing them up by empowering growers in ways they never imagined.\n\nWhy does this matter to you?\nPicture this: a master grower right in your pocket, dishing out real-time, spot-on advice. That\u2019s Master Growbot. With cutting-edge AI, it catches plant problems early, offers tailored tips, and helps you level up your growing game\u2014all while making it fun and stress-free. Whether you\u2019re a seasoned pro or just starting out, it\u2019s your trusty companion for growing smarter and with confidence.\n\nI get it\u2014I\u2019ve been there. I\u2019ve fumbled through the ups and downs of growing, so I built Master Growbot to solve those headaches. And here\u2019s the kicker: you can try it free until April 20, 2025. No catch, just pure support to help you thrive. Let\u2019s shake up cannabis growing together! Got a question or a growing challenge? Drop it in the comments, and let\u2019s tackle it as a community!"

Businesses have so much valuable content - websites, documents, product pages, videos - but most chatbots just ignore it.\n\nWith Neurally, we wanted to create an AI assistant that actually understands your business. You upload your content, and within minutes, you\u2019ve got a chatbot that can answer real questions with real context. No prompt engineering, no technical setup.\n\nWe\u2019re currently live with:\n\t\u2022\tWebsite widget\n\t\u2022\tWhatsApp AI chat integration\n\t\u2022\tSupport for PDFs, sitemaps, text, and more\n\t\u2022\tFull customization of chatbot UI\n\t\u2022\tLive chatbot preview as you build\n\nWould love for you to check it out, and if you have feedback, feature requests, or even harsh truths - I\u2019m here for it all.\n\nThanks for stopping by!\n\nLokesh\nFounder, Neurally"

I'm an alum of the Stanford AI Lab and Y Combinator, and now the CEO of TalkToSales.\n\nToday, I\u2019m proud to announce the launch of TalkToSales, which pioneers a new way people can interact with computers.\n\nTalkToSales adds AI assistants to websites: they can answer visitors' questions, give them live tours of the website or app, and even help them book follow-up calls and buy things right in the conversation.\n\nUnlike traditional websites, which are the same for everyone who visits them, the TalkToSales assistant customizes the conversation and content shown to every visitor, whether the content is dynamic slides, a website/app tour, or both.\n\nTalkToSales also lets the people behind a website offer to \"drop in\" in place of the AI assistant and talk with visitors directly, when visitors accept. Shopkeepers in physical stores have always been able to talk to customers as they browse, but it hasn't been possible to do this on the web until now. We think this could be quite useful for companies that do business online to have more personal engagement with web visitors.\n\nWe think TalkToSales assistants can be helpful for a number of use cases:\n\nSoftware sales: the website itself can become the first sales call, answering visitors' questions, qualifying their good fit and intent, and booking follow-up calls for good leads.\n\nSoftware onboarding and support: Imagine a Clippy that actually worked, talking to you over voice and actually taking actions in a web app for you as you ask it for how to do things.\n\nE-commerce: Imagine having a personal shopper on e.g. the Home Depot website, where a virtual man in an orange apron could show you different dishwasher models and help you pick between them.\n\nReal estate: Imagine going to an apartment building's website and having a virtual real estate agent answer your questions, give you virtual tours of apartments, and book you for a real-world tour.\n\n(Any other ideas? We're all ears!)\n\nWe think TalkToSales assistants can also be very helpful from an analytics point of view - instead of just seeing who visits your page and for how long, imagine being able to see which questions people have, what objections prevent them from engaging deeper, etc. TalkToSales logs transcripts of conversations and the AI can surface patterns from those conversations from you.\n\nPlease try it out and let us know what you think! And if you know anyone else who'd be interested in this, I'd appreciate you sharing it with them."

Airial is the personal travel agent with AI superpowers.

Being avid travelers, we were traveling for several months a year and spending multiple days planning and booking each trip. Hours and hours of research, browsing, watching videos, form-filling, spreadsheets, refinements etc. As we dug deeper, we realized that the scale and the intensity of this problem is stunning - hundreds of millions of trips are booked online every year and planning each of them takes over five hours on average.</p><br><p>Our vision <em>\u201cJust imagine your trip, and Airial it!\u201d</em> stems from our ultimate wish as travelers - AI that can figure out all the intricacies of trip planning for you - hotels, activities, flights, trains, transits, deals, date options, restaurants, interests, research, travel videos and everything else.</p><br><p>Airial is the only travel planner out there today which creates plans crafted to the last detail, like a a travel agent truly would. We pick flights, hotels, transportation and plan every single day of your trip in detail around these choices and your preferences. The defining features that set us apart from competition originate from the core beliefs that Airial is built on:</p><ul><li><p>\ud83d\udcc5 <strong>Detailed intricately crafted plans:</strong> Attention to detail makes trip plans incredible. Airial plans trips in a level of detail that is simply unmatched, taking care of hundreds of common sense constraints across thousands of variables in seconds.</p></li><li><p>\ud83d\ude80 <strong>From Reels to Itineraries:</strong> TikTok / IG reels to Trips is work that millions do manually. We now enable all this in a click. This is the intersection of the two big trends in travel - AI and Socials.</p></li><li><p>\ud83c\udfd6\ufe0f <strong>Personalized Planning:</strong> Travel portals today are one-size-fits-all. We plan trips tailored to your specific interests - architecture tours, scenic hikes or samurai sword fighting lessons!</p></li><li><p>\ud83d\udc46 <strong>Actionable Itineraries:</strong> Just having a chatbot pick out one combination for you isn\u2019t practically useful. Which was the last trip you planned that didn\u2019t need any refinement? Every decision Airial makes for you is changeable via chat or UI controls.</p></li><li><p>\ud83c\udf0e <strong>Discovery in context:</strong> As you plan your trip, Airial gives you the tools to discover incredible ideas and expert advice specific to your itinerary and interests which can be instantly imported into your trip.</p></li></ul><br><p>Vacations are for relaxation.

We\u2019re so excited to bring the next generation of Gyroscope to everyone.\n\nThis version makes our signature trackers even better \u2014 letting people easily track food, places, calories and much more \u2014 and also upgrades our AI coaching system to be about 100x more intelligent than the first version we released a few years ago.\n\nThe most common goal people have when signing up is losing bodyfat, so we\u2019ve optimized the entire experience around that. With the new protocol (and free course), you\u2019ll have everything needed to ensure that the weight loss comes from bodyfat rather than valuable muscle mass. Whether on GLP1 meds where this is essential, or just wanting to lose a few pounds after the holidays, we think this protocol can change the world if everyone follows it.\n\nWe just put the app up in the app store, so give it a try and let us know what you think!\n\nPS: Since this is a common question: The app does require an iPhone right now, the android platform currently isn\u2019t quite polished enough to meet the our quality bar\u2014but hopefully one day in the future that will change"

            "body": "<p><strong>Can AI Make Good Music?</strong><br><br>My answer is an unequivocal yes- and that\u2019s why I co-founded <a href=\"https://flowhop.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Flowhop AI</a>, where we\u2019re using the latest generative tech to create killer lofi hip-hop beats.<br><br>If the words \u201cAI\u201d and \u201chip-hop\u201d in the same sentence are enough to pique your interest, feel free to check it out now. But if you like a good origin story, read on.<br><br><strong>The Blissful Years</strong><br><br>I was fortunate to grow up in a musical household and started playing music at a young age. I stayed active in bands from high school through my thirties.<br><br>Despite my love for music, I realized early on that it wasn\u2019t an ideal way to make a living. For that, I turned to coding.<br><br>The thing about coding is it demands long stretches of uninterrupted screen time. And like many developers, I needed a soundtrack.<br><br>For years, that soundtrack could be just about anything: bebop jazz, thrash metal, gritty hip-hop, hardcore punk\u2014even some country. The genre didn\u2019t matter. I could listen to whatever I liked and still stay focused, productive, and incrementally happier.<br><br><strong>The Turning Point</strong><br><br>Then, a few years ago- though I\u2019m not sure exactly when- something strange happened. <br><br>After a lifetime of voracious and wonderfully promiscuous music consumption, I found I could no longer listen to most music while working. It had become a distraction. Especially hip-hop, with its vivid imagery and clever wordplay, pulled my attention away from the work.<br><br>This was a bummer, to say the least, but it led to my discovery of lofi hip-hop. <br><br>The instrumental, often chilled-out, beats were perfect. It became my go-to music whenever I needed to lock in at the keyboard for a few hours.<br><br><strong>The Problem</strong><br><br>Chances are, some of you are also fans of lofi hip-hop. A quick search on YouTube will confirm its popularity. But after a couple of years listening to the top channels, I started to get bored.<br><br>I heard the same tracks a bit too often, and many of the beats shared a bit too much of the same sound palette.<br><br>I wanted more: more variety, more diversity, and more music that sounded like the golden era of sample-based hip-hop I grew up loving.<br><br><strong>AI Changes the Game</strong><br><br>A few months ago, I started playing around with the new wave of AI music-generation tools. I wasn\u2019t trying to start anything- I was just curious.<br><br>The early results? Pretty incredible.<br><br>Soon I found myself wondering, \"<em>Can this thing make lofi hip-hop?</em>\"<br><br>After more focused experimentation, I got my answer. Not only could it make lofi beats- some of them were <em>really, really good</em>. It could even make tracks that echoed the soulful, sample-heavy vibe of golden-era hip-hop.<br><br>That\u2019s when the lightbulb went off.<br><br><strong>Flowhop AI</strong><br><br>Once the vision became clear, I started generating songs like a madman\u2014and recruited one of my best friends (a fellow musician and technologist) to help polish the results for release.<br><br>At <a href=\"https://flowhop.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Flowhop</a>, we\u2019re building the <strong>biggest and best catalog of lofi hip-hop beats on the planet</strong>- music for focus, study, creativity, and flow.<br><br>Whether you\u2019re coding, cramming, writing, or slaying monsters in your favorite game, we want to be your soundtrack.<br><br>Enjoy!</p>"

We're incredibly excited to share our AI-powered redaction platform with you today!</p><p><br>The journey of Redactable began when I was working as a loan consultant and realized something alarming \u2013 those black boxes I was drawing over my clients' sensitive information weren't actually protecting their data. Anyone with basic technical skills could access what was underneath. This wasn't just a small oversight \u2013 it was a massive privacy and security gap affecting countless professionals handling sensitive documents.</p><p><br>We built Redactable to solve this problem once and for all. Our platform doesn't just visually hide information\u2014it permanently removes sensitive data, including hidden data and metadata that most people don't even know exists. And we've made it 98% faster than traditional tools.</p><p><br>What I'm most proud of is that we're democratizing document redaction. Before Redactable, redaction was incredibly time-consuming or required expensive enterprise solutions. Now, professionals across legal, healthcare, finance, government, and other sectors can protect sensitive information efficiently and reliably \u2013 from any browser, without downloads or complex training.</p><p><br>I'd love to hear your thoughts and answer any questions about Redactable. And if you've ever struggled with document redaction, I'd be curious to learn about your experience! \ud83d\ude80</p>"

However, the access to legal review is time consuming and costly, so majority of the times, we sign agreements and documents based on 'trust'. However, when trust is broken that is where our signed documents do not help us as we did not review them thoroughly. For example, you signed an NDA thinking that you should not talk about any confidential matter, however, you did realise that the NDA stopped you from even taking the name of the company and now they are suing you because you just took their name. Similarly, you signed a consent form for your child's trip but did not realise that you have waived all rights for mishaps happening due to negligence on the part of school.\n\nPersonas is an AI powered tool which uses vectors to analyse each document in detail. The AI generates the levers based on each document type, where the levers are key aspects under which the document needs to be reviewed. The system also seeks your preferences for each aspect so that the system processes based on your expectations. Finally, in under 2 mins you get the entire document reviewed with each aspect marked as Red, Green or Amber based on the severity of the issue. The best part, if you review such documents regularly, like NDAs coming from various customers, vendors etc, you can create a persona with your preferences and every time a new NDA comes, you can get it reviewed based on your persona with a single click of a button.\n\nGive it a try and let me know if you think it would help you in being safe from signing documents with clauses which can be detrimental to you in the long run."

I\u2019m a CS student who loves music and events, and I built Event_Beats to solve a problem I faced\u2014creating playlists that vibe with everyone at parties and late night padel games. It\u2019s been a game-changer for my friends and family, and as a music fan, I can say the AI recommendations are really good and aren\u2019t too mainstream! we use AI to turn guest song requests into Spotify playlists that match the mood. The project is currently available for spotify due to the apple api development  fees and to 25 users for our MVP. Of you have an event this weekend, please try it out, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts."

Add authentication to your app? Implement a new API endpoint? These are perfect Solver tasks.<br></p><br><p>We're especially strong with Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and actively support Go and Rust ecosystems, though we work with many languages.</p><br><p>\ud83e\udd1d WHY WE'RE HERE</p><br><p>We built Solver for developers, but product managers and other team members started using it too.</p><br><p>We're engaging with the Product Hunt community because many of you work across technical and non-technical roles.</p><br><p>Your feedback will directly shape our roadmap as we consider which features to prioritize for different types of users.</p><br><p>\ud83d\ude80 GETTING STARTED</p><br><p>Sign up through our homepage at <a href=\"https://solverai.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://solverai.com</a> or go straight to the app at <a href=\"https://app.solverai.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://app.solverai.com</a>.</p><br><p>We'll be around all day to answer questions and would love to hear your thoughts!</p><br><p>Special thanks to <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/@chrismessina\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@chrismessina</a> for hunting us!</p><br><p>- Mark, Dan, and the Solver team</p>"

With <strong>Needle Knowledge Threader</strong>, we've built a bridge between <strong>discovery and action</strong>.</p><br><p>In a workspace fragmented across Google Drive, Slack, Notion, and Jira, Needle now provides a <strong>unified command center</strong>.

We use an AI to summarize and track activity over time. Zysu allows users to request in plain English what it should say or do. The bot will use its memory and recent activity to interact! Followers can even compete for its attention! We had to build a super efficient system to make our free tier possible, this was a much harder problem than it looks.\n\nWho?\nWe are working to support every social media platform. We listen to our users, and currently have a lot of video game streamers. We support useful features they requested for YouTube, Discord, and Twitch. Anyone can still sign up and try things out!\n\nWhat's Next?\n1) Browser plugin for voice capture during streams\n2) AI bot that can be summoned to chats on Twitch and Discord. YouTube if users demand it.\n3) AI content creator finder chat\n4) AI content creator chat and notification based helper designed to offer real time advice and funding opportunities that don't bother your followers\n\nCan Anyone Ask for Features?\nTotally! We only want to build what people want. Just note that we have to give some priority to our paying customers."

I\u2019m open to feedback and constructive criticism to make it better. I\u2019d love for you to give it a try and let me know what you think.

Navigable AI is a no-code LLM fine-tuning platform that helps you easily build &amp; integrate an intelligent AI assistant into your product. Here\u2019s what the assistant does:</p><ul><li><p>\ud83e\udded AI-Suggested Navigation: Guides users to the most relevant pages in your app using suggestions.</p></li><li><p>\ud83e\udd16 Automate Actions: Lets the AI perform actions on behalf of your users using LLM tool calling, while re-using existing business logic.</p></li><li><p>\ud83d\ude04 Context-Aware Responses: Let's you create fine-tuned models to understand your product and deliver precise answers, using your product documentation.</p></li></ul><p>With our platform and SDKs, building and integrating a fine-tuned assistant that does all of these things is super easy, all while keeping costs low (more than 80% savings)!<br><br><strong>Who\u2019s it for?</strong></p><ul><li><p>Products looking to build an AI Assistant to help users find the right features.</p></li><li><p>Websites needing a simple Q&amp;A bot that answers questions with precision.</p></li><li><p>Freelancers and service providers who want to create and integrate AI chatbots with minimal effort and cost.<br></p></li></ul><p><strong>What's our story?</strong><br>LLMs became popular, but most products can only do so much with LLMs, summaries &amp; simple content generation mainly. We were looking for other use cases when we realized that LLMs are smart enough to guide users, but only if it knows your product inside-out. For this, we decided to go with the LLM fine-tuning approach. With insights from my partners, we built Navigable AI to simplify the LLM fine-tuning process using a no-code approach, taking care of the heavyweight tasks and avoiding common pitfalls. A side-effect benefit of this process was huge reduction in cost. Because we are able to use a smaller LLM for fine-tuning to get good results, we are saving big on the inference costs.<br><br><strong>What do we need?</strong><br>We\u2019re eager for feedback on both our product idea and execution. If you have any suggestions or questions, please drop them here. And if you like what you see, feel free to share it with others! Also, If you need a customized LLM fine-tuning solution, we can make it happen. Just get in touch and we'll help you out.<br><br></p><p>Thanks for checking out Navigable AI. We can\u2019t wait to hear your thoughts! \ud83d\ude80</p>"

Over the next 3 years, my team built bots for hedge funds, influencers, and high-income traders who were all facing the same issue: time, inconsistency, and burnout.\n\nNow we\u2019ve packaged that into Archaide \u2014 an AI agent that lets anyone automate their trading strategy with natural language prompts.

Instead of just focusing on conveying my message, I often spend more time making sure it sounds like it came from an educated adult rather than a 3rd grade kiddo.<br><br>No matter how creative or brilliant an idea is, people can misunderstand or even ignore it if the message doesn't come across well. It's pretty understandable, right? If your writing sounds like a third grader's, people subconsciously judge your intelligence.<br><br>I know there are plenty of products out there that can help with this, but I'm a Slacker -- I mean, a big fan of Slack (not an actual slacker, literally). I love Slack and want a tool that integrates seamlessly with it. I want to improve the experience, type faster, and customize my message tone depending on who I'm chatting with. Sure, you can get a lot of these features for free from ChatGPT or other tools, but constantly switching windows, copying and pasting, and manually prompting every time is a pain. I want to do it quickly with no extra steps. That's why I built this tool\u2014for myself and for others.<br><br>I was a Principal Engineer at a Fortune 500 company that takes customer data security seriously by encrypting everything. Working with encrypted data is a PITA, but after dealing with it for so long, it has become second nature to me. Now, I'm addicted to this pain (yeah, it's contagious). All of our products encrypt customer data before storing it in the database, and we rotate keys regularly.<br><br>You've probably heard companies brag about encrypting data at rest and in transit. That comes out of the box with cloud-managed services\u2014but it doesn't mean their employees can't access your data. I'm not saying they'll do anything shady (but who really knows? ahem... me ta). With our approach, data is encrypted using AES-256 before it even reaches the database, making it virtually impossible for anyone to extract meaningful information.<br><br>One more thing -- this particular product doesn't store your messages permanently. They're encrypted in the cache layer for only a short time before the TTL kicks them out. If you disable the preview feature, we won't even cache them. Your messages will just pass through\u2026 like your ex.</p>"

We thought there was room for something transparent and dev-friendly that just works for most search use cases out of the box. Meilisearch AI is another step in this direction.</p><p><br>Our key features are:</p><p>\ud83d\udd0e  Full-text search with simple, expressive ranking rules</p><p>\ud83e\udde0 AI-powered hybrid, semantic, and multi-modal search</p><p>\u26a1\ufe0f Sub 50ms latency, optimized for end user search</p><br><p>We\u2019re excited to stabilize AI-powered search to allow developers to integrate fast and relevant search, retrieval-augmented generation, and recommendations in their apps. Building upon a year of open-source beta, our managed offer comes with the scalability, security, and monitoring you need to stay focused on building, not managing infrastructure.</p><br><p>For the occasion, we\u2019re offering 2 months of free Meilisearch Cloud subscription. Use the \u2728 \"MeiliAI\" \u2728 coupon to get started.</p><br><p>We can\u2019t wait to hear your thoughts!</p><br><p>For more details on our launch, check out: <a href=\"https://meilisearch.com/launch-week\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://meilisearch.com/launch-week</a></p><br><p>Happy building \ud83d\ude80</p>"

            "body": "\ud83d\udc4b Hey Hunters,\n\nI\u2019m Jasmin, Co-founder of Gemoo. We\u2019re back with something completely new. \n\nToday, we\u2019re introducing Gemoo, an AI-powered video editing tool that makes content creation effortless.\n\n\ud83c\udfac What\u2019s New in the All-New Gemoo?\n\nGemoo eliminates tedious editing by automating subtitles, B-roll, cuts, and effects, allowing you to create polished, high-quality videos in minutes. Here\u2019s how:\n\n- AI-Powered B-Roll Insertion \u2013 Stop searching for stock footage. Gemoo analyzes your video and auto-inserts relevant B-roll to make your content more dynamic.\n\n-  Auto Subtitles &amp; Custom Captions \u2013 No more manual transcription. Gemoo generates accurate subtitles instantly in 100+ languages, complete with customizable templates that fit your brand.\n\n-  Smart Effects &amp; Dynamic Zooms \u2013 Need to emphasize key points? Gemoo automatically adds zoom-ins, motion effects, and trendy visuals to keep your audience engaged.\n\n-  Edit Video by Editing Text \u2013 No timeline needed! Gemoo allows you to edit your videos as easily as a Google Doc. Simply modify or delete text in the transcript to trim the corresponding video segments.\n\n-  Turn Long Videos into Viral Clips \u2013 AI detects key moments in your video and helps you cut them into short, engaging clips\u2014perfect for YouTube Shorts, TikTok, and Instagram Reels.\n\n-  AI Titles, Descriptions &amp; Hashtags \u2013 Let AI generate optimized video titles, descriptions, and hashtags to improve discoverability and engagement across YouTube, TikTok, and more.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Why We Completely Transformed Gemoo\n\nWhen we first launched Gemoo, it was built as a video messaging tool for communication and collaboration. But as we listened to our users and studied the evolving video landscape, we realized something: content creators, marketers, and businesses needed better, faster ways to create compelling videos.\n\nTraditional editing is time-consuming. Searching for B-roll, manually adding captions, cutting clips for different platforms\u2014it all adds up to hours of work. We wanted to remove the friction from the video creation process and let AI handle the heavy lifting.\nSo, instead of just iterating on the old Gemoo, we boldly decided to rebuild it from scratch\u2014with AI-driven video editing at its core.\n\nThe result? A completely new, smarter, and more intuitive Gemoo. One that makes video editing as fast and effortless as possible, without sacrificing creativity.\n\n\ud83d\udcbc Who Is Gemoo For?\n\u2705 Content Creators &amp; YouTubers \u2013 Create high-quality videos faster and focus on growing your audience.\n\u2705 Social Media Marketers \u2013 Boost engagement with polished, AI-enhanced videos optimized for every platform.\n\u2705 Educators &amp; Course Creators \u2013 Turn lectures into engaging lessons with auto-subtitles and perfect B-roll footage.\n\u2705 Businesses &amp; Agencies \u2013 Scale your video production without increasing your editing workload.\n\n\ud83d\udd0d So, What\u2019s Next?\n\nWe\u2019re thrilled to bring the new Gemoo to you today, and we\u2019d love your feedback! \ud83d\udca1\nYou can try Gemoo for free today \u2013 no credit card required. Just upload a video, let AI handle the tedious tasks, and see how much faster and easier video creation can be.\nWe\u2019d love to hear from you! Drop your thoughts, feedback, or questions in the comments. We\u2019re here all day answering questions and taking notes to keep improving. \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Try Gemoo now: <a href=\"https://gemoo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://gemoo.com/</a>\n\n\ud83d\udcb2What\u2019s more?\nWe\u2019ve prepared an exclusive 20% off coupon for the Product Hunters: PH20OFF. Enter it at checkout to unlock full access to Gemoo. \n\nThanks, Product Hunt! We can\u2019t wait to see what you create with Gemoo! \u2764\ufe0f\n\nBest, \n\nJasmin\n\nGemoo Team"

The idea for ChatterKB was born from two real-world challenges I encountered while working with an agency. First, I was asked if there was a way to transform documents\u2014like video transcripts\u2014into a branded, shareable chatbot. Second, the agency couldn\u2019t understand why there wasn\u2019t an affordable solution that enabled their team to quickly find insights during client calls or while drafting emails based on previously created content. This sparked the creation of ChatterKB\u2014a tool that lets you build an interactive, AI-driven repository of ideas and insights, much like an evolving newsletter or your own personal assistant, available in both public and private modes. For the tech-savvy, think of it as a RAG as a Service with reporting and branding.</p><br><p><strong>Two Powerful Solutions in One Platform</strong></p><br><p><strong>For Teams</strong></p><p>\u2022 <strong>Accelerated Analysis:</strong> Upload your documents and chat your way to insights in minutes, not hours.</p><p>\u2022 <strong>Enhanced Collaboration:</strong> Pin key findings, share real-time reports, and keep your team aligned.</p><p>\u2022 <strong>Data-Driven Decisions:</strong> Uncover hidden connections within your documents to empower smarter strategies.</p><br><p><strong>For Creators</strong></p><p>\u2022 <strong>24/7 Engagement:</strong> Convert your content into an interactive hub where your audience can ask questions anytime.</p><p>\u2022 <strong>Custom Branding:</strong> Tailor the look and feel to match your personal or brand style.</p><p>\u2022 <strong>Monetization Options:</strong> Choose from free offerings or premium subscription tiers to even generate revenue from your expertise.</p><br><p><strong>Powerful Features &amp; Integrations</strong></p><p>\u2022 <strong>Seamless Integration:</strong> Import content directly from Notion, Google Drive, and more.</p><p>\u2022 <strong>Advanced AI Models:</strong> Powered by leading models like LLama 3.3 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet, delivering precise and nuanced responses.</p><p>\u2022 <strong>Flexible Pricing:</strong> Start free with up to 30 monthly chats and one knowledge base, or upgrade to the Plus plan at $30/month for more capacity and features.</p><br><p>ChatterKB is all about unlocking and sharing the power of your knowledge\u2014whether it\u2019s for boosting team productivity or engaging your audience in a fresh, interactive way.</p>"

During my tenure as Director of Economic Development for Montana, I witnessed firsthand the challenges that cannabis legalization presented to workplace and public safety, as well as the unfair treatment that cannabis users endured from chemical drug tests. Traditional drug tests cannot distinguish between past use and current impairment, creating a deeply unfair situation for cannabis users. These tests commonly lead to adverse employment action or impaired driving charges for safe and responsible cannabis users as a result. We need a test for actual impairment from cannabis and other drugs and that's what we've built.\n\nGaize is a real-time impairment detection platform that objectively measures current impairment by conducting a series of automated eye tests based on the Drug Recognition Expert process. We conduct tests using a VR headset with embedded eye tracking sensors, then analyze the resulting data using a combination of machine learning and analytical models. The product is over 98% accurate today and getting better all the time. Our goal is to provide businesses and law enforcement with a fair tool that allows them to maintain safety without unjustly affecting those who use cannabis responsibly. \u200bThe product is used today by some of the top safety-sensitive businesses in the US.\n\nI'm eager to hear your thoughts!"

Our software and systems are siloed, data isn't saved or shared, and 90% of it is unstructured\u2014so, generally unusable. In an already complex industry, this lack of organization and clarity not only makes development and operations challenging, but downright risky.</p><br><p>There's millions of data points that need to be collected, organized, verified, analyzed, and utilized. The old school solution was ignoring this problem until you had enough capital to hire analysts and scientists. Now, there's no need for this \"ten-finger\" automation, because artificial intelligence can read, analyze, and predict based on collected data faster than humans\u2014and continuously.</p><br><p><strong>\ud83d\udca0 Introducing Building, Inc</strong></p><br><p>Building answers a few essential questions that real estate stakeholders have had for a while: where can I find this document? Is this data correct? When was this information updated? What do I not know that might pose risk to this project? How do I protect my investment?</p><br><p><em>Our flagship product: The Data Room</em></p><p>Data repositories aren't new, but they're also not smart. Building connects to any server or repository you're currently using to store data and becomes a data layer on-top. This lets you own your data while Building becomes a steward, making information available to your stakeholders or running AI algorithms for extracting key information from your documents. Every document is hashed to the blockchain, create an immutable proof of the document's state.</p><br><p><em>Our unique integration: Tokenization</em></p><p>We believe digital assets are the future and that tokenization is a cutting-edge way to unlock value in traditionally illiquid markets. In order to do this successfully, financial assets need a lot of data. This is where Building comes in: after collecting and verifying property data, Building supports asset appraisal with integrated valuation models\u2014then, that value can be put on-chain in the form of a security token. The best part? It's dynamic and real-time, updating with each new document in the data room. This offers unprecedented transparency and flexibility for those looking to buy, sell, trade, or collateralize their digital assets.</p><br><p><em>Risk analysis and other AI tools</em></p><p>With a plethora of data available through our platform, one can only imagine the hundreds of AI agents that could begin analyzing building codes, design plans, pro-forma, or asset performance. This makes Building a cornerstone for real estate intelligence. What's next, derivative markets?</p><br><p><strong>\u2692\ufe0f Unlock the value of your real estate data</strong></p><br><p>Whether you're a real estate developer or asset manager, if you need to digitize your back-office, automate your workflows, increase transparency for your stakeholders, and want to future-proof your properties with tokenization, Building is your answer\u2014and the only solution in the market of its kind.</p><br><p>Explore <a href=\"https://building.inc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://building.inc</a> and learn how we can save you time and money, plus add value to your assets. Reach out to our team and we'll help you pick the right package for bringing your real estate portfolio into the modern age.</p><br><p>If you aren't a real estate developer or asset manager but still want to see the product in action, we are always looking for strategic partnerships. For example, if you're a lender and want better transparency and risk analysis while underwriting a client, we can white label the product for your needs.</p><br><p>Special thanks to every person who's contributed decades of real estate knowledge to make this platform a reality.</p>"

            "body": "I built an invisible AI tool to help you pass coding interviews. Here's why I had to.\n\nHi, I'm Danny, the creator of Interview Code Ace. Interview Code Ace is an invisible, undetectable AI tool that helps you pass the technical interview. Our desktop application is completely hidden to common streaming and proctoring platforms used in programming interviews such as Hackerrank, CodeSignal, Coderpad, Zoom, even Discord, and more.\n\nI started Interview Code Ace for one reason, to help in the pursuit of finally getting rid of obnoxious 90-120 minute long online assessments and online technical leetcode style interviews. These tests are NOT indicative of a developers true skill. So needless to say, I hope this tool becomes eventually obsolete.\n\nHow and how much?\n- Hidden globally registered commands (hidden from streaming and proctoring sites)\n- Hidden from streaming platforms (specific info about certain platforms in Documentation and in app)\n- Intuitive and easy to remember commands for discreet desktop app interaction\n- Clickthrough mode at the push of one command, allowing to click past the app for stealth\n- Movement commands to keep your eyes on the prize, your eyes never have to leave the main display\n- Problem too big for 1 screen? Multi screenshot covers you allowing for larger problem help\n\n$25 monthly for access to GPT-4o mini or save 67% with base yearly plan for $100\n$50 monthly for access to GPT-4o (Best model) or save 70% with pro  yearly plan for $180\n \n\nWhy do this? The Lore\nI'm a Software Engineer with 5 years of experience. I recently had an interview for a Software Engineer III position at a well known company. The entire interview process took 5 rounds. Yes, 5. 4 of which were technical LeetCode style questions. Now, I'm no master of LeetCode, but I'm also no slouch clocking in about 250+ problems (40-40-20 about split between easy med hard), including the Blind 75 for good measure. I went through all 4 technical interviews and aced each and every problem (according to the different interviewers), I had seen them before.\n\nA few days after my last technical, I got the news\u2026 rejected. 190k base salary position plus bonus all gone. I was shocked. I studied so damn hard for these interviews, only to be told they were moving along with other candidates. Here's the secret though, I got lucky. I got 4 exact problems back to back that I had seen before. I didn't know when the next time I would get such good results in an interview. I've always been a middle of the line developer, but this one hurt.\n\nAfter about a week of getting over the rejection, I just had enough. I do not believe LeetCode should be the industry standard. So I created Interview Code Ace. Am I here to suggest the solution or alternative? No, not at all. I'm here to force it. Give software devs the time of day again. I hope for a day where you get the common courtesy of applying to a job and speaking to a human, and given a genuine opportunity to showcase your skills. We've already been seeing trends towards in person interviews for some companies, and that's when I decided, it's time to put our foot on the gas and make these companies sweat even more.\n\nFinal note, I want to give a lower entry point price for people than compared to other similar applications. Hence, why we offer a few options to help out programmers of all skill levels. You don't need the Turbo Max XD AI 5000 model to pass LeetCode questions. But, we do offer a more powerful option for those needing help with custom problems given to you.\n\nI thank you for reading this and I hope we can create a better interviewing future for software engineers. I wish you all the best in your future technical interviews!\n\nInterviewCodeAce: <a href=\"https://interview-code-ace.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://interview-code-ace.com</a>\n\nDanny"

I'm thrilled to share our journey with you today!\n\n\ud83c\udf31 The Origin Story:\nAccord was born from a real problem I faced throughout my engineering career. Early on, I worked at a company with a complex real-time auction engine where I experienced exponential growth thanks to their well-documented Architecture Decision Records (ADRs). This practice of documenting not just WHAT decisions were made, but WHY they were made became my engineering philosophy.\n\nAs I moved into leadership roles, I implemented ADRs at every company I joined, with remarkable results: faster onboarding, more thoughtful discussions, and clearer technical direction. But the tools we used (Confluence, GitHub, Asana) were never quite right for the job.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 The Lightbulb Moment:\nWhen LLMs became publicly available, I immediately saw the opportunity to create something transformative - a dedicated platform for technical decision-making with AI assistance.\n\n\u2728 What Makes Accord Different:\n- AI-powered guidance that helps teams create better ADRs\n- Real-time collaboration for faster consensus\n- Centralized repository that preserves institutional knowledge\n- A structured approach that bridges technical and non-technical stakeholders\n\nI'd love to hear from you! Have you used ADRs in your organization? What tools do you currently use for technical decision-making? What challenges do you face when documenting architectural decisions?\n\nLooking forward to your feedback and questions! \ud83d\ude80"

Each one was a separate tab, login, and vibe \u2014 but I wanted a unified, clean interface that just worked.\n\nSo I built it. For myself at first. Then for friends. Now it\u2019s ready for you.\n\n\u2728 What PantherAI does:\n\t\u2022\tSwitch between multiple AI models instantly (GPT-4o, o3-mini, Claude 3.7 sonnet, Gemini, Grok 2, Deepseek r1... and lots more coming soon).\n\n\t\u2022\tUse each model for their unique abilities\n\t\u2022\tCompare outputs, tones, styles, or reasoning across LLMs\n\t\u2022\tUse it as a playground for thinking, building, or brainstorming\n\nJust visit the site and go:\n\ud83d\udc49 <a href=\"https://pantherai-irol.onrender.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://pantherai-irol.onrender.com</a>  (yes i'll buy a proper domain soon lol)\n\nI\u2019m still building it in public \u2014 feedback, ideas, feature requests, or even \u201cthis sucks\u201d messages are all welcome.

Fastrack is the world's first agentic AI hiring manager that automates repetitive HR tasks like talent sourcing, shortlisting, candidate outreach (email + call), scheduling, and applicant tracking \u2013 at scale. Check out the demo: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/94BjSubAV20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://youtu.be/94BjSubAV20</a>\n\nI've been working as an AI engineer for 4+ years and spent ~6 months in technical recruitment, where I saw firsthand how tough hiring can be. Getting 1,000+ candidates within a couple of days was easy. But even after using various ATS, I still had to sift through HUNDREDS of candidates manually, and even good ones got lost due to outdated keyword matching.\n\nEven with AI tools out there, shortlisting was still a hassle. Most tools only had a chat UI, with minimal actual automation. Calling, emailing, and scheduling were additional pain points, especially with expensive subscription fees and no single solution to handle all the repetitive tasks. Fastrack solves all of this!\n\nWe enable SMBs and enterprises to hire ~83% faster with data-driven insights at every stage, allowing recruiters to focus on what truly matters: connecting with candidates and making the right hires. Fastrack meets you where you work, seamlessly integrating with any ATS/CRM or functioning as a standalone CRM for centralised applicant + hire tracking.\n\nThis problem matters to my team and many others because hiring should be about people, not paperwork. For example, we recently helped a startup founder with no TA team hire an ENTIRE engineering team in &lt;2 days. We do this using a Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach, combining multiple small, specialised models to create one large model that mirrors human decision-making \u2013 offering the MOST accurate shortlisting in the market.\n\nOur MVP isn't perfect, but it's ready for early adopters who want to make their hiring process faster AND better. We've already received incredible feedback from customers. While we currently don't have an auto-trial registration, feel free to reach out to me personally on WhatsApp at +92 319 9829120 or by email at <a href=\"mailto:huzaifa.cosmosys@gmail.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">huzaifa.cosmosys@gmail.com</a> to book a trial.\n\nWe're looking for founders, HR/TA teams, and independent recruiters to pilot Fastrack and provide feedback so we can improve. We'd love to offer free trials to everyone, but as a small team from a smaller region, running Fastrack isn't cheap. Would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions!\n\nThanks,\nHuzaifa (and the entire Fastrack team)"

Instead of painstakingly modeling objects from scratch, you can now describe what you want, and the AI generates the 3D shape.\n\nHere's what stands out:\n\n\u270d\ufe0f Text-to-3D: Just type a description (like \"a cartoon spaceship with large fins\"), and Cube 3D generates the object.\n\ud83c\udfae Roblox Studio Integration: It's built directly into Roblox Studio, so it's easy for Roblox creators to use.\n\ud83d\ude80 Fast Prototyping: This is going to be huge for quickly iterating on ideas and building out game worlds.\n\ud83d\udd2e Roblox is planning to add image input, full scene generation, and \"4D creation\" (making the objects functional) in the future. They also plan to open-source the model.\n\nRight now, it's focused on generating 3D shapes (meshes), so you'll still need to add textures and materials.

JuicySearch uses Typesense with our proprietary algorithm to provide the most relevant results possible.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 250k+ Quality Profiles - We don't have every profile, but we've carefully filtered for quality creators from OnlyFans. Each profile is classified using local LLMs for image recognition and text classification, creating the best database on the market.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Advanced Sorting Options - Sort by popularity, price (free, low, or high), newest, age, and content type - options our competitors don't offer.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Comprehensive Filtering - Find exactly what you're looking for with filters for age, gender, body preferences, fetishes, and content types - solving problems other platforms haven't addressed.\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Location-Based Search - Find creators anywhere with our location database. We have detailed state and city data for the US and country-level data worldwide. This was challenging as many creators don't share their location, but our AI helped extract this valuable information.\n\n6\ufe0f\u20e3 Full-Screen TikTok-Style Mode - Beyond the traditional grid view, enter our immersive full-screen mode to browse results with more creator details and images - a feature I personally love.\n\n7\ufe0f\u20e3 Simple Wishlists - Save your favorite creators with a single tap, no account creation needed.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Coming Soon: Image Search - We're building a powerful feature many have requested but no one has delivered: upload a photo and find that person if they're in our database, plus see lookalike creators. \n\nThanks to multiple uncensored local LLM models, we've achieved sophisticated classification of our OnlyFans database, helping users narrow down search results with precision that other platforms simply can't match.\n\nI spent days researching Reddit discussions about OnlyFans search engines and incorporated all the most-requested features that competitors have missed. The result is JuicySearch - the most comprehensive, user-friendly OnlyFans search engine available.\n\nWhat feature are you most excited to try? I'd love to hear your feedback! \ud83d\udcac"

On your local device (PCs or Phones), perhaps100,000 or more (document) files should be processed before they can be used effectively with large language models (LLM, local or cloud). <br><br>The good news is that you now don't need wifi connection or a powerful desktop/workstation to enjoy AI and LLM. The APP (Vecy) is available in Google Play Store<br><br><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vecml.vecy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://play.google.com/store/ap...</a><br><br>It is basically the same APP announced 5 month ago</p><p> which was used to demo the effectiveness of the AI search and database system we have been developing. <br><br>The Vecy APP should work on all Android devices, although it has been tested mainly on the newest NPUs, Qualcomm 8gen4 (Samsung S25) and 8gen3 (Samsung S24). <br><br>How many documents your device may have? I checked my old laptop (with a 500GB SSD). It has 2,9 million files, among which 200,000 are \"data files\" (PDFs, Excels, PPTs, DOCs, Texts, etc). Nowadays, phones with 1TB storage are common. There is also trend that people may want to use phones (e.g., folding phones) for work and education, in addition to taking photos and entertainment. <br><br>Enterprise AI search will have to deal with (100s of) millions of data files, not just 100,000 data files. Industry practitioners will need a powerful database and AI search tools to process/manage the data files in order to feed them to AI/LLM, to enhance their businesses to the next level. This APP helps demo the database system we have been developing. <br><br>Vecy APP will automatically index your photos and documents. Users can also directly upload local files to the APP. For example, one can upload the Anthropic RAG benchmark dataset (90 documents, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ttd0BmJ-VppL723Jx-YtyB_pgo_UYxt0/view?usp=drive_link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://drive.google.com/file/d/...</a> , for your convivence to download them) to the APP and ask the benchmark questions, for example<br><br>What feedbacks are used in this fuzzer?<br><br>On my Samsung 24 (last year's) phone, I get the correct response from LLM (after selecting the 90 documents for RAG) in about just 1 second (not 1 minute, which you might experience with similar APPs). <br><br>In summary, the APP does the following <br><br>1. Chat with local LLMs, no connection is needed. <br>2. Index your photo and document files <br>3. RAG, chat with local documents<br>4. Photo search <br><br>Considering that many users don't have an android device, we also replicate the functionalities of the APP on the cloud <a href=\"https://chat.vecml.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://chat.vecml.com/</a> , where users can chat with local (7B) models (including Deep Seek R1) and files uploaded to the cloud. Users also have the option of choosing the size of RAG return, ranging from 400 tokens to 4000 tokens. Some users already discovered that <a href=\"https://chat.vecml.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://chat.vecml.com/</a> also works well for tables and Excels. <br><br>Please feel free to contact us if you enterprises would like to try the AI search, RAG, and database system we have been developing. <br><br>Thank you all. <br><br>Best regards.<br><br>Ping Li<br>The above comment is from linkedin<br><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7308844726080741376/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7308844726080741376/</a></p>"

For example, the top-ranking product, despite its visibility, is hampered by a chaotic and poorly designed webpage. Its interface is cluttered with disorganized content, inconsistent formatting, and a lack of intuitive navigation, creating a frustrating experience that discourages effective use. Beyond this, most other tools in the market rely on outdated methods, simply pulling from a static database and randomly combining pre-existing words. This rudimentary approach produces name suggestions that are often repetitive, uninspired, and disconnected from the creative depth that DND enthusiasts expect.\n\nTo overcome these limitations, I\u2019ve developed a new DND name generator that stands apart by integrating advanced AI technology and offering an extensive array of customization options. Unlike conventional tools limited to random word pairings, my product harnesses the power of AI to craft unique, meaningful names that align with each user\u2019s vision. Players can personalize their experience by selecting from a rich set of parameters\u2014such as character race, class, background, and even thematic preferences like mystical, heroic, or ominous tones. This flexibility ensures that every generated name feels purposeful and tailored to the specific needs of their DND campaign. By moving beyond the repetitive outputs of older generators, my tool empowers users to create truly distinctive names, delivering a one-of-a-kind experience that enhances immersion and elevates their storytelling. With this innovative approach, my product redefines DND name generation, offering a seamless, personalized, and engaging solution for players seeking to enrich their gaming adventures."

The model then generates a 3D-consistent video following that trajectory.<br><br>It's built on diffusion models, but it's not just generating pixels. It's creating a coherent 3D representation, which allows for smooth, long videos (up to 1000 frames!). They've achieved state-of-the-art results on novel view synthesis benchmarks.<br><br>The code is open-source, though the model itself is under a non-commercial license for now.

Most AI is built for solo users - it stumbles over a few files, forgets everything when the chat ends, and leaves your team\u2019s insights scattered across dead-end conversations. <a href=\"http://Fast.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Fast.io</a> changes that.</p><br><p><strong>The Problem</strong></p><p>Current LLM and AI analysis tools fall short.

Forget app-switching, forget limitations. Eliorai's here to unleash pure, unfiltered AI chaos\u2014and you\u2019re gonna love every second of it.</p><br><p><strong>The Big \"Why\" Behind Eliorai</strong></p><p>Picture this: the AI revolution's raging\u2014chatbots, image generators, music makers\u2014but WhatsApp, where over 2 billion humans spill their lives, is still stuck in the stone age. We saw that travesty and said, \"Nah, we're fixing this.\" After months of caffeine-fueled coding marathons and relentless testing, Eliorai was born\u2014a beastly AI that fuses cutting-edge tech into your WhatsApp chats. No more hopping between apps to flex your creativity or get shit done. It's all here, right in your pocket, where you already live.</p><br><p><strong>Not Just Another AI\u2014It\u2019s a Freaking Experience</strong></p><p>We didn't build Eliorai to be \"good enough.\" We asked: \"How do we make an AI so dope, so mind-blowingly fun, that you'll want to chat with it every single day?\" The answer? Technical wizardry meets personal magic. It speaks 100+ languages, groks your voice messages, and dishes out thoughtful answers. But that's table stakes. The real insanity kicks in when you flip the switch to <strong>\"Beast Mode.\"</strong> Oh yeah, shit's about to get wild.</p><br><p><strong>\ud83d\udd25 BEAST MODE: Where WhatsApp AIs Go to Cry</strong></p><p>Other WhatsApp AIs? They're sipping weak tea while Eliorai's chugging rocket fuel. <strong>\"Beast Mode\"</strong> is our war cry\u2014no more basic text replies, no more yawn-fest features. We've unleashed a creative arsenal that'll transform how you flex, connect, and straight-up dominate your chats. Here's the lineup:<br></p><ol><li><p><strong>\ud83c\udfb5 Turn Words Into Songs That Hit Like a Freight Train</strong></p><p>Imagine this: you scribble a few sappy lines about your boo, tell Eliorai \"make it a soulful R&amp;B jam,\" and minutes later, you're dropping a pro-grade song in your chat that'd make Drake jealous. This isn't some sci-fi pipe dream\u2014it's live, right now, in WhatsApp worldwide. Weddings, birthdays, anniversaries, or just because\u2014your words become music, and it's personal as hell.<br></p><p>Early adopters are losing their minds:</p><ul><li><p>One dude shocked his wife with an anniversary song about their first date\u2014she bawled, he scored major points.</p></li><li><p>A crew of friends cooked up a birthday anthem that turned a surprise party into legend status.</p></li><li><p>Long-distance lovers ditched boring texts for musical love bombs. \"I sent my girl a song from my own lyrics, and she called me sobbing\u2014it said what texts never could,\" says Michael K., an early beast-mode warrior.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Photos Reborn as Art That Slaps</strong></p><p>In a world obsessed with visuals, Eliorai's your cheat code. Snap a selfie, a pic of your dog, that epic sunset from your last trip\u2014upload it, toss in some direction like \"make it a Van Gogh fever dream\" or \"turn my cat into a steampunk pirate,\" and <em>boom</em>\u2014Eliorai spits out art so dope you'll question reality. It's instant, it's in WhatsApp, and it's yours to flex.</p><p><br>Real stories from the trenches:</p><ul><li><p>One user turned her dating profile pics into renaissance masterpieces\u2014matches spiked 300%, dates ensued.</p></li><li><p>A dad's been remixing his kids' pics into weekly art drops for the grandparents\u2014new family heirloom alert.</p></li><li><p>\"I made my dog a medieval knight and sent it to my group chat. They lost it,\" laughs a tester who's now the squad's art lord.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>\ud83c\udfa8 Dream It, See It, Share It\u2014No App Hopping</strong></p><p>Text-to-image AI is hot, but most tools demand PhD-level prompting skills or a separate app. Screw that. With Eliorai, you type \"a punk rock dinosaur shredding a guitar in a lava pit\" or \"a floating city with rainbow waterfalls,\" and seconds later, you've got a pro-tier image to sling into your chat. No fuss, no extra downloads\u2014just raw creative power where you already are.<br></p><p>It's flipping the script on communication:</p><ul><li><p>Marketers brainstorm visuals mid-chat, no Slack detour needed.</p></li><li><p>Teachers whip up lesson art on the fly\u2014kids stay hooked.</p></li><li><p>\"I'm trash at visuals, but now I\u2019m dropping custom memes in my group like a pro,\" says Jamie T., a product manager hooked on the juice.</p></li></ul></li></ol><br><p><strong>Beyond Beast Mode: Your 24/7 AI Sidekick</strong></p><p><strong>\"Beast Mode\"</strong> steals the spotlight, but Eliorai's a full-on companion:</p><ul><li><p><strong>\ud83d\udcda Pocket Tutor</strong>: Math, science, history, whatever\u2014get practice problems, breakdowns, and guidance. \"Calculus was kicking my ass till Eliorai walked me through it. C to A-,\" says Sarah L., a college sophomore.</p></li><li><p><strong>\u270f\ufe0f Writing Wingman</strong>: Emails, posts, stories\u2014Eliorai edits, suggests, and sparks ideas. \"It's my round-the-clock editor,\" says Carlos M., a freelance hustler.</p></li><li><p><strong>\ud83d\udd0d Image Decoder</strong>: Upload a plant pic for ID, a screenshot for fixes, a landmark for lore. Privacy? Ironclad\u2014your stuff stays yours.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Fits Like a Glove</strong></p><p>Eliorai's genius is its zero-friction vibe:</p><ul><li><p>No new app to clog your phone.</p></li><li><p>No steep learning curve\u2014just chat.</p></li><li><p>No subscription hoops outside WhatsApp.</p></li><li><p>No habit overhaul\u2014text it like a friend.</p></li></ul><p>Just message Eliorai, and you're rolling with AI firepower.</p><br><p><strong>Free Beast Mode\u2014For Now</strong></p><p>For our Product Hunt debut, we're dropping a <strong>3-day free tier</strong>. Click \"Open WhatsApp\" and unleash the beast in seconds. No strings, just pure chaos to play with.</p><br><p><strong>The Future's Insane</strong></p><p>Eliorai's just warming up. Coming soon:</p><p>- Set reminders and events\u2014your personal and intelligent scheduler</p><p>- Video clips from text\u2014think TikTok meets AI.</p><p>- Group chat co-creation with your crew.</p><p>- Tune Eliorai's vibe to match your personality.</p><br><p><strong>Why This Matters</strong></p><p>In a sea of disjointed apps, Eliorai's a middle finger to complexity. It's not about more tools\u2014it's about smarter integration. AI should live where you do, and WhatsApp's the battlefield. Ready to join the <strong>\"Beast Mode\"</strong> uprising? \ud83d\udd25<br></p><p>#BeastModeAI #WhatsAppRevolution #AIEverywhere #CustomAISongs #NoMoreAppSwitching, #CalAI, #PlantAI</p><br><p>We'd love your feedback and thoughts!

However, at a quick glance you can see several rather large limitations: 1. the fact that its structure is a tree can be quite constraining, 2. there's usually still quite a gap between the KPI and what you're actually able to directly influence, and 3. It's static which makes even simple updates to the business difficult to handle.\n\nOur product is an attempt at solving these inefficiencies and adding prediction, simulation and measurement of all metrics and KPIs from the bottom up to aggregate metrics like profit, giving the user a true model of their business."

BabelShark localizes these UI elements to visitor's language on the fly automatically (you choose which target languages you support).</p><br><p>BabelShark uses automated translator once to translate each string. After that, translation goes to the database and you can review and edit it (with the help of AI, too). Edited translations will change for all visitors.</p><br><p>Cons: there's currently one major disadvantage - SEO. We translate strings on client side. If your website has static HTML, Google index the original text. We plan to get this solved, but currently we target to React, Vue, Meteor and similar web frameworks.</p><br><p>Here's the very minimal CodePen example: <a href=\"https://codepen.io/babelshark/pen/pomjMNW\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://codepen.io/babelshark/pen/pomjMNW</a></p>"

I am sure most product managers still work in spreadsheets because either some tools are good for project management or others are good for engineering management. So, I build Penome based on first principles of product management i.e. Goals, levers that move the needle and measure each lever using a contribution score. Keep it simple to focus on feedbacks and then map feedbacks to each epic while keeping ruthless prioritization in the front. The best possible thing that can happen to any product is to have a monthly rolling roadmap. Also, added AI to help augment requirements within given framework that learns from the existing set of requirements. \n\nAs I strongly believe that feedback is a gift. I would love you guys to encourage me by trying out this product management tool and give me feedback. Also, spread some love by recommending others to try out this product management tool in their organizations and asking them to give me feedback. reach out to me on twitter ( X ) at @amitgoel78 or connect with me on LinkedIn too"

Well, kind of..\nWe had spun up some AI workloads, a few dev environments, and that one database, the junior dev swore he\u2019d turned off. Next thing we know, the cloud bill showed up like a bad ex \u2014 uninvited and emotionally damaging.\n\n\u201cWhere the hell did all this come from?\u201d I yelled into the void (Telegram). \nNo answer.\n\nThat\u2019s when it hit me \u2014 CloudOps and cost management today feels like fighting a boss battle with a wooden sword. And that\u2019s why we built nomi.cloud \u2014 your snarky, no-BS cloud sidekick that keeps tabs on your GPU, compute, and AI workload costs before your CFO throws a chair. \n\n\ud83e\udd16 So, what the heck is nomi.cloud?\n\nIn short, nomi.cloud is your FinOps &amp; CloudOps co-pilot for AI, GPU, and compute-intensive workloads.\n\n\u2705 Real-time cost visibility \u2014 so you know exactly what\u2019s draining your wallet.\n\u2705 Smart usage monitoring \u2014 alerts when someone leaves an expensive instance running (yes, Chad from ML team, looking at you).\n\u2705 Automated kill-switches \u2014 because forgetting is human, but draining budget is dumb.\n\u2705 Budget guards \u2014 protect your startup runway like your life depends on it (because it kinda does).\n\u2705 Multi-cloud support \u2014 Shadeform, AWS, and others (AWS bill therapy group coming soon).\n\n\ud83d\udcac But why the name nomi?\n\nBecause Nomi is your new frugal, pleasant but slightly sarcastic cloud bestie. She doesn\u2019t trust \u201cfree-tier\u201d promises and double-checks your cloud spend the way your grandma double-checks every restaurant bill.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf Who\u2019s it for?\n\n    AI researchers tired of explaining costs to finance.\n    Founders who thought they were on a budget.\n    Teams running GPUs or AI workloads.\n    Anyone sick of unpredictable cloud bills and spreadsheet hell.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Our mission:\n\nModern Infrastructure management, in the age of AI, should be simple. We try to make cloud compute affordable, accountable, and kinda fun \u2014 or at least less rage-inducing.\n\n\ud83d\udd25 We\u2019re live today on Product Hunt!\n\n\ud83d\udc49 nomi.cloud - Your AI cloud spend's new worst enemy (and best friend)\nWe\u2019d love your feedback, your horror stories, or just show some love in the comments.\n\nLet\u2019s make cloud costs predictable, accessible and transparent, one snarky notification at a time.\n\nP.S. First 100 signups get early access and free credits \u2014 because your wallet deserves a break.\n\n\u2014\n\n\ud83d\ude0e Cheers,\nSDG\nFounder @ nomi.cloud"

With Claude 3.7, it's now possible like never before - and it's absolutely killer. It's essentially Claude Code tightly integrated with Github, Slack, Linear and more - the modern developer toolkit.\n\nThis is not a contrived demo. We're constantly merging PRs in enterprise repos. It's often faster to kick off Codegen in a Slack thread than to open VSCode, push up a branch, etc. We've found it *especially* useful in scenarios where multiple humans are collaborating real-time. Fastest way to push collaborative dev initiatives forward.\n\nI've been at the bleeding edge of code generation for years now and it's incredible to me how far we've come. Claude 3.7 is shockingly resilient, resourceful, and will go for *hundreds* of iterations even in the face of ambiguity, broken tools, etc. It just finds a way.\n\nAccelerate your development today! Install at <a href=\"https://codegen.sh/install\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://codegen.sh/install</a>\n\nAnd as always, we love feedback from the community.

I'm excited to share our product with the PH community.<br></p><br><p><strong>\ud83d\ude80 What is Zeus?</strong><br>Zeus is the fastest way to build AI agents. We let you build powerful text &amp; voice agents that integrate with 40+ apps. You can deploy them in seconds as a chatbot, phone number, regular schedule, or an API. Use Zeus to automate your customer support, personalize marketing campaigns, qualify sales leads, answer inbound phone calls, or even build your own personal assistant. <br><br><strong>\ud83e\uddd0 Why did we build this?</strong><br>2025 is meant to be \u201cthe year of the agent\u201d but it\u2019s already March \u2014 why aren\u2019t we using agents every day? We believe it\u2019s actually quite hard to build production-ready agents. You have to set up logging and evaluation tools, integrate with all of your apps, set up deployment infrastructure, and stay up to date with the newest models\u2026 <br><br>Why isn\u2019t it just unbelievably easy to build and deploy AI agents? That\u2019s what we\u2019re building at Zeus: a platform that integrates with all the tools you use, handles all the boilerplate of testing and deploying, and integrates with the latest text and voice models. You focus all your energy on building your agent, we handle the rest.<br><br><strong>\u26a1 How does Zeus work?</strong><br>Zeus makes it dead simple to build AI agents:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Build</strong>: Write your prompt, connect your tools and knowledge, and play in our playground</p></li><li><p><strong>Test</strong>: Simulate real world test-cases to make sure your agent stays accurate on every change</p></li><li><p><strong>Deploy</strong>: Deploy your agent as a chatbot on your site, a phone number anyone can call, a cron job, or connect to it through our API.</p></li><li><p><strong>Observe</strong>: Review every agent run with granular message history, spans, and traces<br></p></li></ol><br><p><strong>\u260e\ufe0f&nbsp;Can you do voice agents?</strong><br>Absolutely! Every agent can be connected to a phone number. You can also configure the voice.  <br><br><strong>\ud83d\ude4b&nbsp;Can you have humans in the loop?</strong><br>Yes! We called these \u201chandoffs\u201d. They can be configured in 1-click.<br><br><strong>\ud83d\udd25 We'd love to hear what you think!</strong><br>- Join our <a href=\"http://withzeus.com/discord\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Discord community</a><br>- Join the conversation on <a href=\"http://withzeus.com/twitter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Twitter</a><br>- Comment below!</p>"

So when we had the chance to work with them to offer this extension we were super excited. Not only can you easily index text for creating your own search engine but this takes AI RAG pipelines to a much higher level. When your RAG workflow goes to use any kind of text search you'll see much faster and better results thanks to the pg_search BM25 index. \n\nIf you don't know much about pg_search here's a breakdown:\n\npg_search is a high-performance full-text search extension for Postgres. It fills Postgres\u2019 gaps in speed, ranking quality, and advanced search capabilities, bringing Elasticsearch-grade features inside Postgres. \n\nThe gaps are this. Postgres has native full-text search (FTS) via tsvector and tsquery, but this is not best-in-class\u2014for example: \n\n* Postgres\u2019 GIN index on tsvector is not optimized for ranking, making queries slower when sorting by relevance.\n* The built-in ranking method (ts_rank) is not as effective as modern search algorithms like BM25, which pg_search supports. \n* Native FTS requires exact matches (no fuzzy search). pg_search can handle approximate matches and typos.\n* Faceted search (the ability to quickly count occurrences of values within search results) is either missing or inefficient in native Postgres. This is a critical feature for real-world search applications and a major reason developers stick with Elasticsearch.\n* Other advanced features like prefix search, highlight snippets, and JSON-aware search are also limited or inefficient in native Postgres FTS."

As someone who's been in tech for years, I rarely get excited about productivity apps, but this one truly stands out. \ud83e\udde0\u23f0\n\nWhat makes Smart Reminder transformative is how it leverages AI in practical, meaningful ways:\n\n- The natural language processing is brilliant - simply type \"Call mom tomorrow at 5pm\" or \"Pay rent on the 1st of every month (finance)\" and it automatically extracts all the details without the tedious form-filling \ud83d\udca1\n- The AI categorization system intelligently organizes your reminders into categories like work, personal, health, finance, and social with precision \ud83c\udfaf\n- It provides insightful schedule analysis with actionable recommendations about time management and suggests optimal times for your reminders \u23f1\ufe0f\n- My absolute favorite feature is the AI message generator that crafts personalized, ready-to-send messages for birthdays, anniversaries, and other events - perfect for those moments when words don't come easily! \ud83c\udf08\n\nThe dual notification system is truly next-gen - you receive both email notifications and push notifications when you install it as a PWA on your phone. The customization options are impressive - choose to be notified immediately, 10 minutes before, or an hour before events. \ud83d\udcde\n\nThe free tier is genuinely useful with up to 10 active reminders, but the Premium plan ($3.99/month or $34.99/year with a 27% savings) unlocks the full power with unlimited reminders, recurring options, and all the cutting-edge AI features. \ud83d\udd27\n\nFor busy professionals, students, or anyone looking to offload mental burden and ensure nothing falls through the cracks, Smart Reminder is the digital masterpiece you've been waiting for. The AI doesn't just make it \"techy\" - it makes it genuinely more useful than traditional reminder apps. \ud83c\udf31\n\nReady to transform how you manage your time and tasks? Smart Reminder is your ticket to a more organized, stress-free life! \ud83c\udf10\u2708\ufe0f"

As an introvert, I wrote my thoughts/feelings/experiences in a Google Doc, which helped me offload my mind and feel better.</p><p><br>I was writing things down, but the systems were slow and disorganized, which led me to write down far less than I wanted.</p><p><br>Twos was designed around three core principles:</p><p><br>1. <strong>Speed \u26a1\ufe0f</strong>: To quickly capture and remember <em>things</em></p><p><br>2.<strong> Ease \ud83d\udc86\u200d\u2642\ufe0f</strong>: So it's simple, enjoyable, and a long-term solution</p><p><br>3. <strong>Shareability \ud83c\udf81</strong> : So you can create meaningful connections with the people you care about</p><p><br>In order to make all three a reality, I built a new technology we call \"things.\"</p><p><br><em>Things</em> are the individual, actionable pieces of information you capture in Twos. They can be notes \ud83d\uddd2\ufe0f, to-dos \u2705, reminders \u23f0, and events \ud83d\udcc6 and are easily reordered \u2195\ufe0f, moved \ud83d\ude9a, and shared \ud83d\udce4.</p><p><br><strong>Today</strong>, we're publicly launching our new AI functionality we call <strong>Twos PALs</strong>.</p><p><br>Personal Active Lists (PALs) uses AI to make smart suggestions based on the <em>things</em> you write down to help you get <em>things</em> done automatically.</p><p><br>Soon we will launch \"Chat with Twos\" (I have it working in my personal workspace) and \"Self-organization\" which will help you organize your <em>things</em> in Twos automatically.</p><p><br>With Twos, you can save time, remember more, and share any*thing* in a simple, yet powerful way.</p><p><br>Use Twos in the browser by visiting <a href=\"https://www.TwosApp.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://www.TwosApp.com</a> and access your <em>things</em> anywhere with our free apps at <a href=\"https://www.TwosApp.com/download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://www.TwosApp.com/download</a>.</p><p><br>Thank you all for reading and happy Twosday! \u270c\ufe0f</p>"

Great but slow (2k active members took forever)<br><br>Then <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/@rustem_kzk1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@rustem_kzk1</a> dropped some wisdom:</p><blockquote><p>We make apps fast.<br>Usually in 6 days. <br>They make money. <br>Let's make something cool.</p></blockquote><p><em>Key points: idea, onboarding, </em><a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/@adapty\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><em>@adapty</em></a><em> magic. </em><br><em>If purchases are consistent, focus on improving the product itself.</em><br></p><p><br>While promoting other products through TikTok creators, we noticed some patterns:<br>\u2022 They're <strong>expensive</strong> \ud83d\udcb8<br>\u2022 Miss deadlines \u23f0<br>\u2022 Deliver inconsistent quality<br>\u2022 Hard to find reliable ones<br>\u2022 They need <em>work-life balance</em> \ud83d\udc85<br><br>Initially thought: \"Let's build an Upwork for TikTokers.\"<br>But wait... it's 2025! Why not leverage AI?!<br><br>\ud83d\udcca From our experience, high conversion comes from:<br>\u2022 As I call it <strong><em>Escort-style</em></strong> content<br>\u2022 <strong>Success stories</strong><br>\u2022 <strong>Relatable content</strong><br>\u2022 <strong>Quality hooks</strong> with eye-catching text overlays<br><br>Also, amount of posting is crucial \u2013 lost count of our accounts on platforms.

Company values<br>d. Key decision-makers<br>e.

Our beta customers LOVE this feature.\u2764\ufe0f<br><br>3) Build GTM action plans<br>I\u2019ve avoided mentioning AI so far because it\u2019s become far too common to present it as an answer in itself.

Using this information and generative AI, Bebop works with you to build GTM plans and materials. \ud83d\udc5f<br><br>Why Bebop stands out?<br>Sales reps and GTM professionals still spend 70% of their time on non-core tasks like, research, personalizing communications and documenting plans\u2014a figure virtually unchanged since 2022. <br>Bebop.ai directly addresses these pain points by:<br>\u2705 Save time\u201430 minutes of company research in seconds <br>\u2705 Tailored sales scripts so you can connect deeply with your customer, understanding their specific needs <br>\u2705 Optimized, high-value lead data to uncover hidden customer opportunities<br>\u2705 Seamless lead exporting for a smooth sales workflow (coming soon)<br>\u2705 Use Bebop to discover revenue streams you never knew existed<br><br>You can check out some videos here:<br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/37nDsmhLm9o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://youtu.be/37nDsmhLm9o</a><br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/pWzPMl4L2-o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://youtu.be/pWzPMl4L2-o</a><br><br>We'd love your feedback \u2013 share your thoughts at: <a href=\"mailto:feedback@bebop.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">feedback@bebop.ai</a><br><br>A perk for the Product Hunt community, use the code PHUNT25 to get 25% discount for 3 months subscription.

This should make it way easier to find relevant AI research.\n\nNow, instead of just keywords, you can describe what you're looking for in natural language.  Super helpful for finding papers on specific topics or using certain methods.\n\nThey've also added a fun \"I'm feeling lucky\" style button (a dice \ud83c\udfb2) \u2013 click it, and it searches a random topic. Great for discovering research outside your usual bubble!\n\nBeyond the new search, Daily Papers already had some great features:\n\n\ud83d\udd25 Curated by Experts: Papers are hand-picked by AK and the community.\n\ud83d\udcac Discussions: You can chat with the authors directly on the page.\n\ud83d\udd17 Related Resources: Links to models, datasets, and demos are right there.\n\u2795 Claim &amp; Submit: Authors can claim their papers and submit new ones.\n\nThis makes Daily Papers an even more valuable resource for staying on top of the rapidly evolving AI research landscape."

I knew there was helpful information in there, but I wasn't quite sure of the what or where, and finding that would eat quite the chunk out of my mornings.\n\nto fix this, I unsubscribed from everything with my personal email, made a new email address, and wrote a little script that turned the tens of emails into a single one that told me what was covered in each newsletter, and what it meant for me from my perspective.\n\nI passed this script to a few friends, and long story short I \"vibe-coded\" an app out of it. DeepLetter gives you three things:\n\nfirst, an inbox generator, giving you an email address you can use to subscribe to any and all email-based services.\n\nsecond, a perspective, where you can describe your career/hobby that you want the script to look at all the emails from.\n\nFinally, a newsletter, where you can incorporate the two and set a send cadence for how frequently you want to receive these summaries.\n\nWould love it if the folks here can check it out and let me know what you think! this isn't a VC-backed whatever where I'm trying to 10x this or 100x that, just trying to reach people this may be helpful to :)"

It\u2019s a bit like magic\u2014watch your ideas materialize in unexpected ways.\n\nCreate Videos\nFinally, our tool stitches these images together with cool motion effects and transitions, giving you a dynamic, playful video.\n\nA Little Backstory\nWe built VidGen out of a personal itch to explore creativity in a less conventional way. Instead of getting bogged down with complex video editing software, we thought: why not experiment? We wanted a tool that\u2019s more about exploring creative possibilities than producing a perfect final cut. It\u2019s been a journey of trial and error, lots of late-night tinkering, and a whole lot of fun.\n\nI\u2019d love for you to check it out at vidgen.leanai.ventures and join me in this creative experiment. Your feedback will be invaluable as I continue to refine the tool.\n\nCheers"

What caught my attention wasn't just her profile - it was a photo of her jumping that stood out from the typical dating app poses. I liked that photo, and miraculously, she liked me back. \u2728<br></p><p>Our connection was instant. From late-night conversations spanning culture to tech, waiting up until 10 PM just to chat with her became my new habit. Two weeks in, we had our first date at a caf\u00e9 in a shopping mall, talking until closing time. \u2615</p><br><p>Our relationship moved at lightning speed. \u26a1 Within weeks, we were discussing meeting parents and marriage. Two months after our first message, we were planning our wedding in a beautiful chapel in Bali. \ud83d\udc8d<br></p><p>Life had other plans, though. My wife got pregnant, I lost my job, and shortly after, we experienced the devastating loss of our first baby. \ud83d\udc94 During those dark days, we leaned on each other, growing even closer through our shared grief. Despite the odd timing, I proposed with a custom ring I'd been waiting for.<br></p><p>We had our wedding in Bali as planned, and soon after, my wife got pregnant again. \ud83e\udd30 That's when the idea for Doola began to take shape.<br></p><br><p><strong>From Personal Need to Product \ud83d\udca1</strong><br></p><p>During her pregnancy, my wife became increasingly concerned about ingredient safety in everyday products. The stress from deciphering complex ingredient lists and the clutter of menu items, to constantly researching what was safe became overwhelming. I watched as she spent hours researching ingredients, taking photos of products at stores to look up later, and feeling anxious about making the wrong choice. There had to be a better way! \ud83d\udd0d<br></p><p>Drawing on my background in technology, I created Doola Scans - an app that instantly scans photos of ingredient labels and within seconds tells pregnant women what's safe, questionable, or potentially harmful. What started as a personal solution for my wife evolved into something that could help millions of expecting mothers worldwide. \ud83c\udf0e<br></p><br><p><strong>What Doola Does \ud83d\udcf1</strong><br></p><p>Doola uses advanced image recognition to scan ingredient lists on food and cosmetic products, instantly analyzing them for pregnancy safety. With a simple photo, expecting mothers can:</p><br><p>\u2022 Get clear safety indicators for each ingredient \u2705\u2753\ud83d\udeab</p><p>\u2022 Understand complex scientific names in plain language \ud83d\udcd6</p><p>\u2022 Save product history for future reference \ud83d\udcdd</p><p>\u2022 Make confident decisions while shopping or dining \ud83d\uded2\ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f</p><br><p>The premium version offers unlimited scans, cosmetic product analysis, and AI-powered scanning for any type of product or menu. \u2b50<br></p><p><br><strong>Why It Matters \ud83d\udcaa</strong><br></p><p>Pregnancy can be stressful enough without worrying about hidden ingredients. Doola gives expecting mothers peace of mind, helping them protect their babies from unknown risks of harsh chemicals. \ud83d\udc76<br></p><p>This app launches on <strong>March 21st - my wife's 38th birthday</strong> - as my gift to her and to all the other expecting mothers who deserve simple tools for making safe choices. \ud83c\udf81<br></p><p>I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback. Doola was born from love and shaped by loss, creating something meaningful from our journey. I hope it brings peace of mind to expecting mothers everywhere. \ud83d\udc95</p><br><p><br><strong>The Bigger Vision \ud83d\ude80</strong><br><br>While developing Doola, a grander vision began to take shape. What started as a personal solution has evolved into something more ambitious. The journey continues at <a href=\"https://doola.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://doola.ai</a> \u2014 still under construction, but growing steadily into a comprehensive platform enhanced with AI capabilities to support expecting parents and families in each of their own unique experiences. \u2728 I'm incredibly excited to watch this seed of an idea, born from love and necessity, blossom into something that could transform how expecting mothers navigate their pregnancy and parenting journey. This is just the beginning... \ud83c\udf1f</p>"

It would be amazing if users could learn about the \"why\" behind the recommendations as they use the app.</p><p>Can't wait to see how this grows.

            "body": "I've tried dozens of AI resume and cover letter generators and all the ones I found have one or more of these shortcomings:\n\n1.  They help you write one perfect resume, like a human coach would, but you still basically submit the same resume to every job even though the requirements and qualifications are different.\n2.  They tweak the resume for every job, but just for ATS purposes and doesn't actually make you stand out more.\n3.  They don't truly analyze the job description to understand where you fit well, and more importantly, qualification/skill gaps that you have.\n\nAs a result, I went ahead and wrote my own AI resume and cover letter generator with these requirements in mind:\n\n1.  Start by uploading your resume to create your base \"user profile\"\n2.  Analyze each past role and ask you questions to expand on what's already in your resume\n3.  Compare your user profile with the job description you're applying to and tell you exactly where you match and where you don't\n4.  You update your profile to \"train\" the AI, expanding your background info\n5.  Generate the best TRUTHFUL resume and cover letter based on your user profile\n6.  The custom resumes and cover letters are ready to \"Save as PDF\" and submit with your application\n\nThis is the first tool out there I know of (there are probably hundreds so I can't be sure) that actually generates better resumes and cover letters over time.  The more jobs you apply to and the more AI feedback you incorporate into your user profile, the better it gets.\n\nThis is my first app ever on Product Hunt so be nice and I appreciate your constructive feedback.\nThe \"Aha\" moment for me was when I realized I had accomplished so much more than what I had written in my original resume, but I didn't think they were important.

So my friend joked about making something similar I got an idea ( I was walking while talking to him and always got good ideas while walking ). I just decided to learn more about how LLMs work, what is Lora, what fine-tuning is, and how to do all these things. I remember fine-tuning my first Mistral 3b model on my Mac it blew me away that something like this was possible I played around dataset a little and tweaked some settings, I quickly called and asked my friend if he remembered his suggestion to create an AI model that's very good at understanding complex human emotions, I somehow convinced him to work on this idea together, so 3 months now the web app is in beta version already 500+ people have tried and returned after 24 hours with avg time spent per person on the platform are 15 minutes. I got a lot of feedback ( really a lot from Reddit and Discord). I only did a few Reddit posts and people loved it so much that it fueled me to work on it more so for the last 2 weeks I have been going insane working on it. It feels tiring but I get a sense of accomplishment because it's my first time working on my own idea so hard."

It creates therapist-ready reports so you can walk into your next session with a clear view of what\u2019s been going on.\n\nIt\u2019s designed for anyone who wants a judgment-free space to reflect, whether you're in therapy or just looking for a more interactive and insightful way to journal.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts!

It\u2019s also super cheap\u2014ChatGPT-4o-mini makes thousands of summaries cost just cents.\n\nWe all know that Apple tried, but it sucks\u2014the summaries are often wrong or useless. And on Android? There\u2019s nothing as good as this. I wanted to build something unique, not just another boring, inaccurate summarizer. That\u2019s where personalities come in\u2014they let you customize how your messages are summarized, adding a fun twist that no other app offers. Try Cowboy, UwU, Valley Girl, Pirate, or Haiku.

I genuinely couldn't stand waiting 10 seconds for it to load each time I opened it, just to set a todo in my Kanban board as done.\n\nI tried exploring existing solutions, but all of them were either:\n\n- Overkill\n- Too expensive\n- Shitty UI\n\nSo I got to work and built my own todo app in 2 days.\n\nI named it Mochido, after the Japanese Sweet, Mochi \ud83c\udf61.\n\nThis really was just a side-project at first, but then somebody else said they wanted to use it as well on X, so I decided to just make it public.\n\nThe best thing about this is, you can treat it like a friend and speak to it in Natural Language, instead of having to perfectly think about what you're going to name the ToDo, which was quite an issue for me when I was still using Notion.\n\nI also added Projects so that specific task information can be inferred from the Project Context.\n\nI am looking for genuine feedback and to see whether people would actually enjoy using this or not.\n\nCurrently supports Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite and OpenAI o3-mini."

You know that feeling when you're studying for an exam, and the resources you find online give you these broad, textbook answers that barely scratch the surface of what your professor actually taught? Yeah, me too. \ud83d\ude05 That's where Study AI comes in.\n\nI envisioned a study tool that felt less like a robotic search engine and more like a supportive, knowledgeable friend. So, I built a chatbot that acts as your personal AI study partner, designed to focus exclusively on your lecture content. Imagine having a tutor who's not only incredibly patient but also knows your lectures inside and out, because, well, that's their entire knowledge base!\n\nStudy AI is about making learning personalized and efficient. It's about getting those 'aha!' moments where everything clicks, because you're getting answers directly tied to what you were taught. It's about ditching the generic and diving deep into the specifics. Whether you're reviewing complex concepts or just need a quick refresher, Study AI is there to help you grasp the material quickly and confidently.\n\nI believe learning should be an enjoyable experience, not a stressful one. With Study AI, I hope to create a space where students feel supported and empowered to excel. I'm eager to hear your thoughts and feedback! Let's make studying smarter and more fun together. \ud83d\udcda\u2728 What are your biggest study challenges, and how do you think Study AI could help?"

Real-time traffic avoidance further prevents idling, cutting fuel costs and emissions.\n\nTime Savings: Optimal routes enable faster completion of deliveries, allowing more jobs per day. This boosts productivity and reduces overtime expenses, as drivers finish shifts on time.\n\nMaintenance Reduction: Fewer miles driven mean less wear and tear on vehicles, lowering maintenance frequency and costs, and extending vehicle lifespans.\n\nDynamic Adaptability: Real-time rerouting around traffic, accidents, or road closures minimizes delays, ensuring timely deliveries and resource efficiency.\n\nLabor Cost Optimization: Efficient routing may reduce the number of vehicles or drivers needed, aligning resources with demand and avoiding overstaffing.\n\nCustomer Satisfaction: Reliable on-time deliveries enhance customer trust and retention, indirectly saving costs associated with lost business or redelivery attempts.\n\nAdministrative Efficiency: Automation of route planning reduces manual scheduling efforts, freeing managers for strategic tasks and reducing labor hours.\n\nData-Driven Insights: Historical data analysis identifies trends, enabling proactive adjustments to routes and schedules for long-term efficiency gains.\n\nEnvironmental Compliance: Lower emissions align with sustainability goals, potentially reducing carbon taxes and enhancing corporate reputation.\n\nExample Impact: Companies using Dynaroute report significant savings, such as a 15-20% reduction in fuel costs and a 10-30% decrease in drive times, translating to direct financial benefits and scalability.\n\nBy integrating these features, Dynaroute not only cuts operational expenses but also drives strategic improvements, fostering a competitive edge through smarter logistics."

Over the past few years, I\u2019ve built several projects, and one thing I kept running into was the struggle to find good, custom illustrations. Stock images felt too generic, custom artwork was often expensive, and I didn\u2019t always have the time (or skill!) to create my own.\n\nThat\u2019s when the idea for IllustraAI hit me.

            "body": "<p>Hey Product Hunt! \ud83d\udc4b We\u2019re thrilled to introduce <strong>BuildForm</strong>, a game-changer in <strong>online form builder</strong> that makes it insanely easy to create powerful forms. If you\u2019ve ever felt held back by clunky form tools, limited freebies, or lack of insights, this is the platform you\u2019ve been waiting for. BuildForm combines no-code simplicity with AI-driven intelligence and seamless integrations, so you can <em>build forms that not only collect data but also learn and improve from it</em>.<br><br>Whether you\u2019re a marketer, startup founder, product manager, or creator, BuildForm is built for you. In minutes, you can whip up beautiful forms (or even conversational form experiences) that engage users and boost conversions. We\u2019ve packed in everything we always wanted in a form builder: unlimited forms and responses, <strong>real-time analytics </strong>that actually make sense, and even an AI assistant that <strong>nurtures your leads right on the form</strong>. It\u2019s like having a growth hacker and data analyst baked into your form tool.</p><br><p><strong>\ud83d\udd25 Highlights &amp; Features</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Unlimited forms &amp; submissions</strong> \u2013 No more worrying about quotas. Create as many forms and collect as many responses as you want, even on the <strong>free tier.</strong> Your creativity shouldn\u2019t have limits, and neither should your form builder.</p></li><li><p><strong>\u2728 AI Statements &amp; lead nurturing </strong>\u2013 BuildForm uses AI to generate personalized statements on the fly from your users\u2019 inputs, so you can engage and nurture leads while they fill out the form (think tailored messages or recommendations shown instantly!). It\u2019s like having a s<strong>mart sales rep inside your form</strong>, boosting user engagement and conversion rates.</p></li><li><p><strong>\ud83d\udcca Analytics &amp; insights</strong> \u2013 Get built-in analytics that tell you the story behind your form. Track submission trends over time, see drop-off rates for each step/question, and learn which devices or browsers your audience prefers. These actionable insights make it easy to tweak your forms and skyrocket completion rates. No more flying blind\u2014know exactly what\u2019s working and what isn\u2019t.</p></li><li><p><strong>\ud83d\udd17 Easy integrations </strong>\u2013 Connect BuildForm to your workflow in seconds. Google Sheets and Zapier integrations are ready out-of-the-box, so your form data flows to wherever you need it (CRM, email, Slack\u2014you name it). Prefer webhooks or other tools? We support those too. BuildForm plays nice with your entire tech stack.</p></li><li><p><strong>\u23f1\ufe0f Partial submission capture</strong> \u2013 Ever wonder how many people started your form but didn\u2019t finish? BuildForm captures partial submissions, so you can see exactly where users drop off and even what they had input before leaving. It\u2019s a goldmine for optimizing forms\u2014find the pain points and fix them to recapture those lost leads.</p></li><li><p><strong>\ud83d\udcac Conversational forms, embeds &amp; pop-ups </strong>\u2013 Go beyond static forms. BuildForm lets you create interactive conversational forms (think Typeform-style chat), or embed forms seamlessly on your website, or even launch them as pop-ups to grab attention. Meet your users where they are and make form-filling feel like a friendly conversation, not a chore.</p></li><li><p><strong>\ud83c\udfa8 Custom branding &amp; design</strong> \u2013 Make every form truly yours. Customize colors, fonts, and add your logo; craft welcome screens and thank-you pages that reflect your brand. There\u2019s zero BuildForm branding on your public forms (even on free plans), so your brand shines through every time.</p></li><li><p><strong>\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Rock-solid reliability !!! \u26a0\ufe0f</strong> \u2013 BuildForm runs on a hybrid multi-cloud infrastructure for 99.99% uptime, because mission-critical forms can\u2019t afford to go down. In plain terms: your forms stay up 24/7 globally, with no random outages or lost submissions\u2014just peace of mind that every response is captured securely.</p></li></ul><p>We\u2019ve been building BuildForm with a passionate community of beta users and iterating like crazy. The result is a platform we genuinely love to use, and we hope you will too. It\u2019s not just a product, it\u2019s a little movement to reinvent how we collect and use data (and have some fun doing it!).</p><br><p>\ud83c\udf81 Product Hunt Launch Offer: Sign up today (11.59 PM PT) using code <strong>PH0316</strong> and get <strong>3 months of the Pro plan free!</strong> We can\u2019t wait for you to try BuildForm, break our limits, and share your feedback.

If you are stuck in your office writing a 20 pages PRD nobody will read, you're not doing your job properly.\n\nWe want to reclaim the time spent on writing documents AND making them better while we are at it. \n\nHow do we do it? \nBy using best practice frameworks you learn about in Product Management courses and AI to skip the blank page problem.\n\nUsing Iteraite, you will get from properly crafted User Persona, User journey, User stories with their Acceptance Criteria, and PRDs. Done in minutes instead of hours. Always in the right context. Prompt engineering - NOT REQUIRED.\n\nWe launch today and a free 14-day trial is available to everyone. No credit card needed."

It's funny as fuck. You start getting your creative juices flow, you modify your prompt 5-7 times, next thing you know - you spent 2 hours just writing funny shit. \n\n2. If you are parent - it writes pretty cool kids stories. Imagine sitting with your kid just writing awesome stories together, bonding, laughing and creating some inside jokes for later, \n\n3. Character creator step is very very interesting. It gives a great breakdown of a character - you can really discover some cool angles to your characters you never noticed before. \n\n4. You can turn it into money. Stories sell very well. This thing can write you product descriptions, emails, and other business crap - just ask.\n\nAt this point, you might be thinking...

There is a big segment of AI apps/agents/tools that people are interested in using a few times a month, but not paying a subscription. For these cases, the best alternative is to let users bring their AI and charge per usage. However, the current popular approach of requesting API keys is broken due to many reasons.<br><br>I created BrainLink so that users automatically pay for the inference they consume on the apps and developers can monetize based on usage, without paywalls, not even a signup form is required.

This brain provides the apps with identity, inference (200+ models available), usage-based monetization, and soon more features that we are adding.<br><br>Once a user has a portable brain, they are just one click away from using any app, they don't have to pass extra paywalls or signup forms, just one click on the app.<br><br>I would love to hear your feedback!</p>"

As one of the first users to try this platform, I can confidently say it's a total game-changer for anyone looking to create stunning visual content without the steep learning curve of traditional video editing software.\n\nThe AI's ability to transform simple text prompts into high-quality videos is nothing short of magical. I was able to generate a professional-looking video for my small business in under 15 minutes with virtually no effort. The interface is incredibly intuitive \u2013 even my 8-year-old nephew could navigate it!\n\nWhat really sets PixelClip apart is the impressive template library that covers everything from social media ads to explainer videos. The customization options are robust enough for professionals but still accessible for beginners. I particularly love how the AI understands nuanced instructions, saving countless hours of trial and error.\n\nThe value proposition is equally impressive. For the price of a basic graphic design tool, you get comprehensive video creation capabilities that would normally require multiple specialized tools and significantly more time investment.\n\nIf you're on the fence about trying PixelClip, don't hesitate! This is one of those rare tools that genuinely delivers on its promise of revolutionizing content creation. I'm already planning to upgrade to the professional plan to unlock even more features for my upcoming projects.\n\n#AIcontentcreation #videomaker #digitalmarketingtools #contentcreationmadeeasy"

We think in note apps, share in communities, and build in development environments. Each transition costs us context, possibilities, and momentum.<br></p><p><strong>Expanse dissolves these boundaries</strong> through a revolutionary architecture that mirrors the fundamental nature of awareness itself:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Everything connects to everything</strong> \u2013 Like awareness that perceives without separation, any entity can relate to anything else through customizable relationships</p></li><li><p><strong>Structure without restriction</strong> \u2013 Just as awareness can hold both form and formlessness, our dot-relationship-configuration model maintains structure while allowing infinite flexibility</p></li><li><p><strong>Seamless flow from thought to reality</strong> \u2013 As awareness naturally manifests what it focuses on, Expanse enables a continuous journey from curiosity to creation<br><br></p></li></ul><p>This is all based on the fundamental philosophy of awareness itself: it has no bounds, no blocks, no artificial stopping points. It flows seamlessly from one thing to the next because it does not define things as \"different\".</p><br><p>This is what we have done in Expanse. Your fleeting thoughts flow seamlessly from your captured thoughts area to the community to being manifested into the world through AI manifesting and deploying it to the world - all without you even having to DO any of that (yes, \"effortless effort\", \"effortless action\" is indeed a core philosophy our our software), it just HAPPENS.</p><br><p>Speaking of AI...</p><br><p>That's what truly sets Expanse apart: it's the first <strong>truly AI-native platform</strong>. Unlike systems where AI is bolted on, our architecture is designed specifically for an AI-human partnership:</p><br><p><strong>Competitors:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Notion's</strong> databases remain <strong>isolated</strong> \u2013 Expanse allows infinite connections</p></li><li><p><strong>Tana's</strong> supertags add structure but <strong>lack relationship depth</strong> \u2013 We build a true graph at both entity and relationship levels</p></li><li><p>Development tools like <strong>Cursor</strong> help build what you <strong>explicitly</strong> request \u2013 Expanse enables AI to discover connections you never imagined and <strong>implicitly build</strong> without limitations</p></li></ul><p>With our uniquely flexible architecture, AI doesn't just operate within predefined constraints \u2013 it generates entire software experiences on demand:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Explore &amp; Capture</strong> thoughts through an interface that adapts to your needs</p></li><li><p><strong>Understand &amp; Discover</strong> connections that would remain hidden in siloed systems</p></li><li><p><strong>Share &amp; Build Community</strong> around emergent insights</p></li><li><p><strong>Manifest Ideas</strong> into tangible reality \u2013 apps, websites, products, businesses</p></li></ol><p>This is a meta-platform where the boundary between human curiosity and AI implementation disappears. You're not commanding AI \u2013 you're dancing with it on an infinite canvas where thoughts naturally become reality (yes I wrote that lol I was on some profession-type beats when I was writing this up lol).<br></p><p>The name \"<strong>Expanse</strong>\" isn't arbitrary \u2013 it embodies our philosophy that software should mirror the expansive nature of awareness itself: undefined until defined, capable of infinite configurations, continuously expanding through curiosity.</p><p>Join our waitlist to help shape a system where humans become more human, and the human-AI partnership dances in perfect harmony through the singular interface that bridges it all: <strong>awareness</strong>.</p>"

            "body": "The biggest issue I had when proofreading with ChatGPT was the endless copy-paste cycle. I'd write everything in MS Word (because let's face it\u2014Word's Track Changes mode is unbeatable!), then I'd paste chunks into ChatGPT for proofreading, wait, and afterward I'd find myself stuck comparing two texts side-by-side, manually hunting for edits to move them back into Word. It was messy, frustrating, and definitely not efficient.\n\nI searched everywhere for a solution\u2014something to seamlessly integrate ChatGPT\u2019s suggestions directly into Word\u2019s Track Changes\u2014but everything I found was external, separate from Word itself. I just wanted simplicity: proofreading right within the Word document where my original text already lived.\n\nEventually, out of sheer frustration, I decided to build exactly what I needed: a tool that lets ChatGPT proofread directly inside Microsoft Word, with edits clearly visible as tracked changes.\n\nI figured I couldn\u2019t be the only one struggling with this, so I decided to create WordGPT.Pro to allow myself to proofread effortlessly within MS Word, keeping all edits organized neatly in Track Changes without ever needing to switch applications again. It solved my copy-paste headache, saved me tons of time, and now I'm excited to see if it can help others too!"

Plus, we're laser-focused on the people using our platform, not just maximizing revenue.</p><br></li><li><p><strong>Affordability &amp; Value</strong>: Most competitors are focused on attracting as many free accounts as possible then converting a small fraction of their users to premium plans. In these scenarios, premium users disproportionally supplement free accounts, resulting in premium plan pricing that can be up to $50 per month (seriously!). That just feels like too much. At Difr, our business model is a little different: Instead of targeting volume, we offer a free trial that lets you test our full set of premium features, then price our plans to be affordable for everyone.</p></li></ol><p>I'd be so honored for you to give it a spin and let us know what you think! \ud83c\udf2a\ufe0f</p><br><p>-Dan<br></p>"

As educators and technologists, we observed that distractions, lack of real-world interaction, and passive learning methods were limiting students\u2019 ability to fully grasp and retain complex concepts.\n\nWe started by exploring how immersive technology could bridge this gap. VR had already shown promise in specialized fields like medicine and engineering, but most VR solutions were expensive, complex, or not designed for everyday classroom use. We asked ourselves: How can we make VR practical, affordable, and accessible for teachers and students everywhere?\n\nThrough research and collaboration with educators, we identified key requirements: a lightweight, distraction-free, and easy-to-use VR system that wouldn\u2019t require constant internet access or complicated setups. The result was Sensible-VR, a 3 DoF headset preloaded with educational content, designed to work seamlessly in schools while addressing real-world teaching challenges.\n\nOur goal was not just to introduce VR into classrooms but to make it a practical tool for enhancing engagement, improving knowledge retention, and fostering interactive learning, all without breaking school budgets. Sensible-VR is the product of innovation, common sense, and a deep commitment to the future of education."

Our goal is to put the most advanced ML and data science techniques and algorithms in the hands of all software engineers, so that you can build AI applications at the same level of performance and sophistication as the big labs. We\u2019re excited to announce our first product launch and keen to get feedback from the maker community.\n\nPi can very quickly:\n\ud83d\udd22 Build your scoring system to reliably measure your AI\u2019s response quality. \n\ud83d\udcac Auto optimize your prompt by running DSPy algorithms against your scoring system\n\ud83e\uddfe Generate cheap high quality synthetic data based on seed input to train your model\n\ud83d\udcc8 Compile high quality reward models to run RL algorithms like PPO and GRPO\n\ud83d\udd04 Build your feedback loop by finetuning your scoring model with your user data\n\ud83d\udd0e Rewrite your queries and customize your Ranking for your RAG backend\n\u2026 and more!\n\nWhat\u2019s special about Pi\u2019s technology?\n** Pi is inspired by the MVC architecture for Web. Scorers on one side of the loop, Optimizers on the other side of it. You update your scorers, they auto-update your optimizers, keeping your loop in sync. All optimizers \"compile\" against the same scoring system. This means you just interface with scoring, letting Pi handle the algorithmic heavy lifting.\n** Pi\u2019s scoring models are small and fast encoder models trained specifically for scoring. They let you assess 20+ quality dimensions in sub 100ms. This means you can use them beyond just evaluation; from reward modeling for RL to online control flow with agents.\n** Pi\u2019s scoring models can be calibrated with human feedback. Manual calibration, labeled data, or preference pairs, your scoring system adjusts to your and your users\u2019 preference creating robust feedback loops for your application.\n** Pi\u2019s playgrounds allow you to easily interact with even complex workflows like synthetic data generation or routing. When you\u2019re done vibe checking any particular technique or algorithm, you can deploy in code to scale.\n\nTry Pi out, no sign in required at <a href=\"https://build.withpi.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://build.withpi.ai</a>. Have Pi build your first scoring system in less than 2 minutes and start optimizing your AI right away. You can also visit <a href=\"https://code.withpi.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://code.withpi.ai</a> for our API reference and links to end to end tutorials and notebooks that show you how to use those techniques in real-world examples.\n\nExcited to hear your feedback!"

At the time we chatted, I was stuck trying to optimize a prompt pipeline that just wouldn\u2019t do what I wanted to do, and I was patching around it in the only kind of way I could with my software engineering toolkit \u2013 with iterative refinement, rules-based approaches and decomposition.</p><br><p>Of course it wasn\u2019t going to work. I had ML-envy, and was eyeing all the fancy RL and finetuning that the ML engineers around me understood, and I didn\u2019t know where to start with. I knew I needed the power of the tools they were experts at, but I couldn\u2019t afford a month away from product development to go off and to find out how to build a scoring model.</p><br><p>And then David told me they were building that! High-level primitives and workflows for software engineers to have the power of ML expertise in their team. I can just download an API token and immediately have the primitives I need to focus on the product.</p><br><p>I\u2019m super excited to start building with Pi. I love a leveraged tool that lets me focus on the product. The roadmap of things that are coming up looks awesome. Congratulations to the team on launching something truly useful right out the gate.</p>"

Now, you don't need to waste time reading long and time-consuming text articles. Just listen to their interactive audio podcasts, which we will deliver to you as a constant audio podcast news feed.</p><p><br>\u23f1\ufe0f<strong>Our Story</strong></p><p>Like many of you, we felt overwhelmed by the amount of content relevant to our jobs, which we needed to keep track of on a daily basis. We were heavy users of RSS readers, but they seem a relic of the past in this era of AI. Surely, there's got to be a better way given all the advances in <a href=\"https://gen.AI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">gen.AI</a> and LLMs, right??</p><p><br>\ud83d\udca1<strong>Our Inspiration</strong></p><p>We were inspired by the simplicity and efficiency of audio books. Listening to short audio summaries of long form content has an appeal like no other. Audio as a format is non-intrusive, allowing consumption to happen while multi-tasking (e.g. driving, commuting, working etc.). Further, the interactive audio podcast format a'la Google Notebook LM makes it even more interesting and engaging. So, why not replicate this for daily content? Thus, was born the idea for <a href=\"https://Sooper.AI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Sooper.AI</a>.</p><p><br>\ud83c\udf1f<strong>Key Highlights</strong></p><p>We don't just create a mere transliteration or even a simple audio summary of the articles. Rather, the podcasts are in the form of a discussion between 2 AI hosts (similar to Google Notebook LM). What's more, the added attraction for users is also the ability to interact live, ask questions about the content and get answers in the episodes itself. <strong>And the best part - Sooper is completely free to use </strong>(we monetize our app through audio ads which are played in the podcasts).</p><p><br>\ud83d\udcb2<strong>Publisher Partner Program</strong></p><p>If you are a content publisher, we also have a partner program wherein we help you drive engagement and monetization for your content. Here's how it works - you can use Sooper to create podcasts of your content and embed the links in your original posts. When users click on them, come to Sooper and listen to the podcasts, we also play a pre-roll ad from which you get a revenue share. You can also do this with ecomm products that you promote. You can embed your affiliate ids to the product podcasts and earn commissions from merchants.</p><p><br>\ud83d\udcac <strong>We Want Your Feedback!</strong></p><p>We\u2019re constantly improving Sooper and want to hear from you! Your feedback will shape future updates, so please let us know your thoughts on the features, and what you\u2019d like to see next.</p>"

It felt frustrating to repeatedly reinvent the wheel instead of focusing on creating something amazing.\n\nImagine how much more productive and creative we could all be if we had instant access to a shared, curated library of high-quality prompts. That\u2019s why I created RapidPrompt, a collaborative platform where founders and AI enthusiast can easily discover, share, and improve prompts together.\n\nOur goal is simple: less time hunting for prompts, more time building great things.\n\nI\u2019m excited to hear your thoughts, feedback, and ideas on how we can make RapidPrompt even better for the community!"

There's no \"starring\" emails or \"marking as unread\" necessary: Hoop uses AI to find your tasks across tools and centralizes them so you never miss another task.<br><br>For meeting tasks, customers told us a meeting bot felt intrusive and uncomfortable. So we went back to the drawing board and reimagined what the ideal experience should be. Coming out of a meeting, you want to know \"What am I on the hook for?\" So we built Hoop for Mac - a macOS app that uses local audio to transcribe and identify meeting tasks. It works with all meeting platforms including Zoom, Meet, Teams, Slack Huddles, and even audio notes. It's connected to your calendar, so you'll get a prompt to start Hoop just in time for each meeting. After the meeting, you have all your tasks alongside context, transcripts, and summaries. And there's no meeting bot involved.<br><br>The best part is that tasks from meetings live alongside tasks from Slack and email. It truly is the only fully automated, AI driven task manager that makes sure you never miss another task.<br><br>Thanks so much for your support! We're excited to see what you think!<br></p>"

I am excited to do my very first Product Hunt Launch, for ApertureDB Multimodal AI Workflows. \n\nIf we want AI to think like humans, it needs all the signals a human brain processes to form our stories, which means multimodal data. Having worked with AI and data for years, I understand the immense challenge users face when trying to leverage multimodal data. Real world data is messy and hard to access. \n\nWhy? It\u2019s scattered in silos, there are different databases or data tools built based on the modality of data, and how on earth do you talk to all those data types through one language? Teams spend countless hours wrangling images, text, and other data types, trying to build AI applications that truly deliver value. This leads to delayed deployments, increased costs, and missed opportunities.\n\nSounds familiar? \ud83d\ude44\n\nThat\u2019s exactly why we built ApertureDB \u2014 a purpose-built database that unifies multimodal data management, vector search, and knowledge graphs into a single backend, delivering up to a 10x productivity boost and accelerating AI deployments by 6-9 months on average.\nBuilding on this foundation, we\u2019re excited to launch ApertureDB Multimodal AI Workflows today \u2014 the easiest way to manage multimodal datasets with just a few clicks on a scalable cloud platform. \n\n\ud83d\ude80 What are ApertureData Multimodal AI Workflows?\n\nWorkflows provide a way to automate the execution of a commonly-performed task, when  managing multimodal datasets for AI.

I started obsessing over LinkedIn\u2019s top creators\u2014dissecting their viral posts, collecting data, spotting the patterns that made them pop. But I didn\u2019t just stop there\u2014I trained an AI to crack the code. Not to churn out generic fluff, but to tailor posts to you\u2014your job, your vibe, your story. And holy crap, it worked.\n\nThat\u2019s ViralGen: your shortcut to LinkedIn posts that slap. Here\u2019s the good stuff:\n\nPost Generator: Viral-worthy words in seconds, not hours.\nInstant Carousel: Scroll-stopping visuals, no design experience needed\u2014minimalistic and sleek.\nAdaptive Style: It vibes with your voice\u2014authentic, never robotic. And it gets smarter the more you use it, learning your style to perfection.\nImage Generation: Create custom images that pop, effortlessly.\n\nOh, and it\u2019s half the price of EasyGen with better tricks up its sleeve. If LinkedIn\u2019s been a slog, this is your escape hatch.\n\nWe\u2019re also adding a LinkedIn agent to automate the grind\u2014trend search, commenting, replying to DMs, and more. It\u2019s everything I needed when I was struggling on LinkedIn.\n\nThe big picture:\nWe\u2019re building a tool that:\n\nFeels like your clever bestie, not a cold machine.\nGets your style so well, it\u2019s spooky.\nTurns creating into connecting, effortlessly.\n\nViralGen\u2019s my first swing at making LinkedIn your playground, not your prison\u2014more cool stuff\u2019s on the way.\n\nWhat do you think?

            "body": "Hello Product Hunt! \ud83d\udc4b I\u2019m one of the makers of Flash, and we\u2019re incredibly excited (and a bit nervous!) to share it with you today. \n\nWe built Flash to make stock research faster and smarter. As investors ourselves, we often felt overwhelmed by the time it takes to read reports, analyze financials, and figure out if a stock is worth buying for the long run. Traditional tools either oversimplified stock analysis or buried us in data. \n\nFlash was born to hit that sweet spot: give anyone \u2013 from a newbie investor to a seasoned pro \u2013 instant, AI-driven insights about a company\u2019s future prospects, in an interface that\u2019s friendly and quick. \n\nFlash\u2019s AI crunches tons of financial data and history to project where a stock might be 5 years from now. Of course, no one can predict the future with 100% certainty (and this isn\u2019t financial advice!), but these forecasts offer a data-driven glimpse into a stock\u2019s long-term trend. To complement that, we provide a quality score that reflects the company\u2019s fundamentals and health (so you know if a company is solid or shaky at a glance). And for those who love to dig deeper, Flash offers one-click access to deep research \u2013 think summaries of financial statements, key insights from earnings calls, and even AI-generated breakdowns of news or trends affecting the stock. \n\nWhy Flash stands out:\n\ud83d\udd2e 5-Year Price Predictions: See where a stock\u2019s price could be in five years, according to our AI models. We analyze historical trends and a wide range of data to forecast a potential future price range. This long-term view helps you look past the daily market noise.\n\ud83d\udcca Quality Rankings &amp; Scores: Every stock gets a simple A\u2013F style grade (and rank) based on fundamentals, growth, and risk factors. It\u2019s like a report card for the company\u2019s health, so you can quickly gauge quality and compare companies.\n\n\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f Deep Research Insights: Dive into why a stock got its score. Flash provides digestible insights \u2013 from revenue growth rates to debt levels, and highlights from SEC filings or earnings calls \u2013 all summarized by AI. You get the gist of lengthy reports without reading hundreds of pages.\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 Simple &amp; Mobile-Friendly: No complicated terminals or bloated dashboards. Flash is clean, minimal, and works great on your phone\u2019s browser. Whether you\u2019re on your morning commute or a coffee break, you can get meaningful stock intel in seconds.\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 Free for Everyone: Flash is completely free to use. No paywalls, no subscriptions. We believe that high-end investment research tools shouldn\u2019t be limited to Wall Street. Our mission is to empower retail investors with pro-level insights at zero cost.\n\nWe\u2019ve been testing and refining Flash with a small group of users over the past few weeks, and the feedback has helped us improve its accuracy and usability. \ud83d\ude4f Now, we\u2019d love to get the Product Hunt community\u2019s feedback. Please let us know what you think! \n\nDoes Flash\u2019s analysis align with your own research? \n\nWhat features can we add or improve? \n\nAny and all thoughts are welcome \u2013 we\u2019re here and listening. Thank you for checking out Flash. We built this to help level the playing field in investing, and we truly hope it helps you make smarter decisions on your financial journey. Ask us anything in the comments \u2013 we\u2019ll be responding all day. Cheers! \ud83d\ude80"

Co-founder of Cuckoo here \ud83d\udc26\n\nIt\u2019s been a long-time dream to post our launch here, and I\u2019m super excited to finally share what we\u2019ve been working at Cuckoo over the past few months!\n\nGunwoo and I started building Cuckoo in Seoul after seeing firsthand how language remains a significant barrier for global teams\u2014especially during highly technical meetings. Meetings with interpreters are often twice as long, and critical details can get lost in translation especially when they don't understand your product your tech. When bilingual colleagues step in as interpreters, they\u2019re pulled away from their core roles.\n\nAt Cuckoo, we\u2019re addressing this issue with a real-time AI translator designed specifically for global sales, marketing, and support. Our customers\u2014Snowflake, PagerDuty, Weights &amp; Biases, and ClickHouse\u2014are already using Cuckoo to break down language barriers as they expand globally. We\u2019ve also seen how early-stage AI startups, including our fellow YC batchmates, are going global from Day 1.\n\nHere\u2019s how Cuckoo works:\n(1) Cuckoo works by joining your online meetings as a bot. (It also works in person).\n(2) You can contextualize translations by uploading relevant documents like pitch decks or product manuals.\n(3) You can easily share the live transcript with your customers and teammates with a link, allowing them to speak in the languages that they are most comfortable with. \n\nCuckoo also provides you with AI-generated meeting notes, so you can follow up on your conversations in 20+ languages.\n\nWe have a free trial\u2014give it a try in your next meeting! We\u2019d love your feedback. For those who are constantly involved in these global meetings, feel free to reach out to me personally at <a href=\"mailto:yonghee@cuckoo.so\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">yonghee@cuckoo.so</a> and I\u2019d be happy to talk!"

But now, our parsing is even sharper. <strong>Our AI now maps funnels with 80% accuracy, meaning 8/10 journeys will go all the way to the paywall.</strong> And if something doesn\u2019t parse, we log it, refine the algorithm, and keep improving.</p><br><p>We\u2019ve also added some powerful features: <strong>real-time alerts when funnels change, custom flow tracking, and seamless Figma export </strong>\u2014 so you can skip the tedious work and focus on running more experiments, faster and smarter.</p><br><p>Huge shoutout to our amazing team for making this happen! \ud83d\ude80 Their dedication, creativity, and relentless work have turned Flowriver into what it is today.</p><br><p>As mobile makers ourselves, we're building the tool we always wanted.

This project was born from my own frustration trying to launch AI-powered SaaS products quickly. After spending countless nights rebuilding the same infrastructure for different projects, I decided to create the ultimate starter kit.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 Why I built this:\n- Tired of spending weeks on auth, payments, and database setups instead of the actual product\n- Saw many devs struggle to integrate Google's Gemini AI with production-ready apps\n- Wanted to make AI entrepreneurship accessible to solo founders and small teams\n\n\ud83d\udccc Some things that aren't obvious from the description:\n- The database schema is fully normalized and optimized for AI chat history\n- All API routes are properly rate-limited and secured\n- We're using Vercel Blob Storage for file handling, which scales beautifully\n- The Stripe integration handles failed payments, subscription changes, and user downgrades\n\nThis is just v1.0 - we're already working on adding TypeScript types for Gemini responses, more UI templates, and AI fine-tuning capabilities.\n\nI'll be around all day to answer questions. Would love to hear what you're planning to build with it!"

I wanted to utilise all this power without having to constantly switch between websites and apps and subscriptions.\n\nThat's why I built Promptly! It brings AI-powered productivity to *any* macOS app. Highlight text or an inut, hit a hotkey, and instantly rewrite, refine, or generate content using your favorite AI models.\n\nI built out the prototype and sent it to a few friends - they loved it but one asked \"Why can't I also use my voice?\" So I added that in too, alongside shortcuts to jump straight into that from anywhere.\n\nPromptly lets you add your own API keys for OpenAI, Gemini, Claude (and Ollama models running locally!). You can also specify which ones you want to be selectable when to mix and match them as you go about your day - some are better than others for different tasks so Promptly lets you pick the best tool for the job. \n\nThere's also a bunch of ways to interact with Promptly - voice mode instantly, chat mode to discuss highlighted content, or the instant edit mode to rewrite/translate/enhance selected text right into your app - no more copy and pasting between apps and websites.\n\nEveryone hates subscriptions, and you likely already have them for your favourite LLM providers so there's a 7 day free trial and a one-time purchase for lifetime access, complete with privacy, and endless possibilities. \n\nBring your own API keys and get started in seconds. Download the free trial and let me know what you think!"

MCP is an exciting protocol, but there is still a lot of tooling that needs to be built around it to turn it from a \"cool toy\" into a legitimately useful protocol. Our platform is an early attempt at addressing this.\n\nTo elaborate a bit, a big part of the challenge when it comes to MCP is reliability. If you expose your entire API through MCP, LLM clients like Cursor and Windsurf get overwhelmed and fail to use your API reliably. Our platform attempts to solve some of these problems around MCP and make it a more reliable and scalable standard for giving context/tools to LLMs. Here is the flow of how it works:\n\n1. You upload your OpenAPI spec on Layer.\n2. Our platform \"cleans\" your spec until it is \"MCP ready\". This involves removing unwanted routes, handling authentication, and more.\n3. You specify which endpoints to expose via MCP and how these endpoints can be orchestrated together. We call this feature workflows, and it give you a deeper level of control over how your MCP server behaves against complex queries and user demands.\n4. We give you ongoing insights and telemetry data on how users are actually using your MCP server.\n\nWe're excited to see what you think of the platform and will be around to answer any questions!"

We expanded context-awareness to entire codebases, made it easy to integrate the latest AI models, and refined how AI fits into real-world development.</p><p>Two years since the first version of Qodo Gen, a lot has changed in the AI landscape.</p><p>New, more powerful models have entered with strong reasoning capabilities. Meanwhile, developers increasingly expect AI to feel native in their workflows.</p><p>With Qodo Gen 1.0, we\u2019re excited to offer agentic workflows, elevating AI coding from auto-complete and single prompt answers to agents that work autonomously through complex coding tasks.</p><p>That means Qodo Gen\u2019s coding agent can make decisions, ask questions, use external tools, and execute multi-step tasks on its own. We built in extensible tooling using Anthropic\u2019s Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling our code and test agents to call external tools to carryout workflows inside the IDE, from web search, to Jira, to gits and more.</p><p>Test generation has always been at the core of Qodo Gen, driving our mission to help developers push high quality code.</p><p>With Qodo Gen 1.0, we introduce a new semi-agentic test generation workflow, helping developers create better, higher quality tests faster.</p><p>It\u2019s an exciting moment for us Qodo, and we hope by using Qodo Gen you can generate confidence, not just code.</p><br><p>Try it out \u2014 <strong>Qodo Gen is available for VSCode and Jetbrains</strong>\u2014we\u2019d love to know what you think in the comment!</p>"

From there we went through YC and spent <em>many, many months</em> talking to users and iterating in the LLM agent space.

Use cases we're seeing include:</p><ul><li><p>E-commerce product data for AI shopping solutions or price monitoring</p></li><li><p>Government sites for bids, rules, and regulations</p></li><li><p>Company career pages for job postings</p></li><li><p>Real estate listings from brokers and MLS systems</p></li></ul><p>If you're scraping 10+ sites regularly, we\u2019d love your feedback\u2014try our platform and let us know what you think.

Traditional rerankers only consider relevance, which doesn't always capture use case-specific preferences.<br><br>\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f What we built:<br>Our reranker lets you specify ranking preferences through instructions like:<br>- \"Prioritize recent documents over older ones\"<br>- \"Prefer PDFs to other sources\"<br>- \"Give more weight to internal-only documents\"<br><br>This means your RAG system can now make prioritization decisions based on criteria that matter to you, not just semantic similarity.<br><br>\ud83d\udcca Performance details:<br>We've tested it extensively against other rerankers on the BEIR benchmark and our own customer datasets. It achieves state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms alternatives. The performance improvement was particularly noticeable when dealing with ambiguous queries or conflicting information sources.<br><br>\ud83d\udc49 If you want to try it:<br>We've made the reranker available through a simple API.

            "body": "Hey Product Hunt community! \ud83d\udc4b\n\nI'm Michael, founder of AppDNA.ai. After 7+ years running an app growth agency, I noticed a consistent problem: most subscription apps fail to hit revenue targets because effective growth expertise is locked behind expensive agency retainers.\n\nThat's why we built AppDNA.ai - to democratize app growth. Our AI analyzes what's working for successful apps in your category to build customized marketing funnels and growth strategies at a fraction of traditional agency costs.\n\nWe're especially proud of our funnel builder that helps you visualize your entire user journey from acquisition to monetization, with specific recommendations for each stage based on what's working in your app category. Our system also creates ready-to-implement A/B test experiment cards, complete with hypothesis, success criteria, KPIs, and full deployment instructions using the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) model, so you can continuously optimize your funnel.\n\nOur ultimate goal is to fully automate the work of an app growth marketer and marketing team through this tool. We want to empower solo founders and medium-sized apps to create and implement sophisticated growth and marketing funnels just like big brands do, allowing them to scale their apps without the massive overhead of a specialized team or agency.\n\nI'd love to hear your feedback and answer any questions! What growth challenges are you facing with your app?"

I know how much the right banner can make or break a campaign.</p><p>\u2728 I\u2019ve lost countless hours (and patience) going back and forth with designers \u2014 not their fault, but still, it\u2019s exhausting.</p><p>\u2728 And as someone who believes in keeping things simple, I wanted to create something that works without you needing to \u201cspeak AI.\u201d</p><br><p><strong>Enter BannsAi. This is your new secret weapon:</strong></p><p>\ud83d\udca1 No-prompts needed: Just type what you\u2019re thinking, as if you\u2019re texting your design team.</p><p>\ud83c\udfa8 No-designer stress: Tweak the banners yourself, at your own pace, in your own style.</p><p>\u2728 No-templates here: Every banner is unique, tailored to your needs, and 100% yours.</p><p>BannsAi is designed to save your time, your money, and \u2014 let\u2019s be honest \u2014 your sanity.</p><br><p><strong>It\u2019s fast, fun, and ridiculously easy to use:</strong></p><p>1\ufe0f\u20e3 Brief BannsAi about your project (just a few words).</p><p>2\ufe0f\u20e3 Add your headline and, if you like, your logo or design ideas.</p><p>3\ufe0f\u20e3 Just chill while BannsAi does its magic.</p><p>4\ufe0f\u20e3 Customize if needed or just hit download.</p><p>That\u2019s it \u2014 banners done.</p><br><p>We\u2019ve spent countless late nights and early mornings perfecting BannsAi because we believe in making your life easier.

A tool that takes the hassle out of banner creation and gives you more time to focus on the creative, strategic, and impactful work you love.</p><br><p>We\u2019d love for you to try it out, share your thoughts, and help us make it even better.

It's the first tool that shows you exactly when ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini and other AI systems visit your site, which pages they read most, AND how many human visitors come to your site through AI citations.</p><br><p>Here's why this matters: When someone asks ChatGPT a question about your industry and it reads your content to answer, you've provided value twice\u2014once to the AI and potentially again when the user clicks through to your site. Yet Google Analytics captures none of this journey.</p><br><p>Setting it up takes just minutes through Cloudflare, Wordpress or Vercel\u2014no code changes needed on your site. You'll instantly see:</p><p>- Which AI platforms visit you most AND drive the most human traffic</p><p>- Your most popular pages for AI crawlers and which convert best to human visits</p><p>- Complete AI-to-human conversion funnel with click-through rates by platform</p><p>- When these visits happen and how patterns change over time</p><br><p>Teams are using this to:</p><p>- Discover which content formats AI systems prefer and cite most frequently</p><p>- Track if optimization efforts are increasing both AI crawler visits AND human traffic</p><p>- Measure the actual ROI of their content through the AI channel</p><p>- Build strategies for what we call \"Generative Engine Optimization\"</p><br><p>This is just the beginning.

We parse the website and agent does actions you prompt it to do. This means: \ud83d\udc47<br><br>\u26a1 <strong>Launch in minutes</strong> - No coding, no selectors, no element tagging.

Agent visits your site --&gt; enters a keyword in a search box --&gt; verifies that relevant search results appear<br>2. Agent visits your login page --&gt; enters credentials --&gt; confirms successful login into the correct account<br>3. Agent completes a purchasing flow by filling in all necessary fields --&gt; checks if the checkout process works correctly<br><br>150+ websites are now monitored by Flowtest AI agent. <strong>Teams can finally sleep better knowing their sites aren't just up but actually functioning.</strong><br><br>We'd love to hear all your feedback and opinions, ask me anything in the comments! \ud83d\ude4f</p>"

            "body": "Hey!\n\nI developed RLAMA to solve a straightforward but frustrating problem: how to easily query my own documents with a local LLM without using cloud services.\n\nWhat it actually is\nRLAMA is a command-line tool that bridges your local documents and Ollama models. It implements RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) in a minimalist way:\nRLAMA extracts text from the documents and generates embeddings via Ollama. When you ask a question, it retrieves relevant passages and sends them to the model.\nThe tool handles many formats automatically. For PDFs, it first tries pdftotext, then tesseract if necessary. For binary files, it has several fallback methods to extract what it can.\nProblems it solves\nI use it daily for:\nFinding information in old technical documents without having to reread everything\nExploring code I'm not familiar with (e.g., \"explain how part X works\")\nCreating summaries of long documents\nQuerying my research or meeting notes\nThe real time-saver comes from being able to ask questions instead of searching for keywords. For example, I can ask \"What are the possible errors in the authentication API?\" and get consolidated answers from multiple files.\nWhy use it?\nIt's simple: four commands are enough (rag, run, list, delete)\nIt's local: no data is sent over the internet\nIt's lightweight: no need for Docker or a complete stack\nIt's flexible: compatible with all Ollama models\nI created it because other solutions were either too complex to configure or required sending my documents to external services.\n\nIf you already have Ollama installed and are looking for a simple way to query your documents, this might be useful for you.\n\nIn conclusion\nI've found that in discussions on r/ollama point to several pressing needs for local RAG without cloud dependencies: we need to simplify the ingestion of data (PDFs, web pages, videos...) via tools that can automatically transform them into usable text, reduce hardware requirements or better leverage common hardware (model quantization, multi-GPU support) to improve performance, and integrate advanced retrieval methods (hybrid search, rerankers, etc.) to increase answer reliability.\n\nThe emergence of integrated solutions (OpenWebUI, LangChain/Langroid, RAGStack, etc.) moves in this direction: the ultimate goal is a tool where users only need to provide their local files to benefit from an AI assistant trained on their own knowledge, while remaining 100% private and local so I wanted to develop something easy to use!"

The code is open-source (MIT).\n\nIt's a great example of how much can be achieved with efficient training and a focus on specific capabilities (like reasoning).

            "body": "<p>I've been using Scifocus for a while now, and it's been an absolute game - changerFirst off, the literature search feature is top - notch. When I was prepping for my research on \"Sustainable Catalysts for Green Chemistry,\" I typed in the topic. Scifocus didn't just throw a bunch of random papers at me. It scoured through a ton of academic databases and pulled out the most relevant ones, complete with summaries. This was a massive time - saver. Before, I'd spend ages looking through journals, not even sure if I was on the right track.The note - taking function is super convenient. As I read through papers, I can quickly jot down key points, and the app even lets me organize them into different folders. It's like having a personal research assistant. I can highlight important passages in the papers themselves and add my own thoughts right there.The writing assistance is another big plus. When I'm drafting my research reports, Scifocus helps me clean up my grammar and also suggests more scientific - sounding words to use. It makes my writing look much more polished.</p><p>I've recommended Scifocus to all my classmates, and we're all impressed. It's an essential app for anyone doing academic research. Whether you're in the sciences, social sciences, or humanities, this app has something to offer.</p>"

This project represents a significant milestone in AI development: I simply prompted Manus AI to create its own open-source alternative, and it built ANUS (Autonomous Networked Utility System) entirely from scratch.\n\nMy role? Just writing the prompt and using Cursor to push to GitHub. That's it. Manus designed the architecture, wrote all the code, created documentation, even made the logo\u2014100% AI work.\n\nWhile people are paying up to $20K for Manus invites, we're making this completely free and open-source. The project combines single and multi-agent capabilities with a comprehensive tool ecosystem and model flexibility.\n\nI'm especially grateful to @eugeneshilow for the brilliant idea!\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts on what this means for the future of AI and software development. Are we entering an era where humans are primarily prompt engineers?\n\nCheck out the repo: github.com/nikmcfly/ANUS"

This builds on their previous HunyuanVideo project, but focuses specifically on turning still images into videos.\n\nHere's the detail:\n\n\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Image-to-Video: Give it an image and a text prompt, and it generates a video.\n\ud83c\udf05 High Resolution: Can generate videos up to 720p resolution.\n\u23f1\ufe0f Up to 129 frames (around 5 seconds).\n\u2728 Customizable Effects (LoRA): This is huge. You can train your own LoRA adapters to create custom visual styles and effects. This gives you a lot of control.\n\ud83d\udd13 Open Source: Code and model weights are available.\n\nIt requires a pretty hefty GPU (they recommend 80GB), but they have optimized inference scripts.\n\nCheck out the video above of a lil cuttie penguin's journey!"

Most courses follow a fixed curriculum, assuming every learner has the same goals. But in reality, some of us want to build web apps, others want to dive into algorithms, and some just need to learn one specific skill for a project. Instead of wasting time on irrelevant lessons, I wanted a way to generate a course that adapts to me\u2014not the other way around.\n\nWith Tailor, you don\u2019t get a pre-made course\u2014you generate your own. Just enter your goal or a simple prompt, and we\u2019ll create a custom learning path tailored to your needs. No fluff, no unnecessary detours\u2014just focused, practical learning.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts! What\u2019s the biggest challenge you\u2019ve faced when trying to learn to code?"

You can definitely tell it's a \"spinoff\" from other AI avatar image generation tools out there, but this one is specifically geared towards \"graduation photoshoot\". Why? Well, it's apparently a very underserved keyword on Google. So I want to test my theory and try to rank for that keyword, and give people who are totally new to AI (I mean universities are usually quite behind on this stuff, so unless the student likes knows about AI, I think the chance is small they learnt all about how this works) a little peek into the power of it! It's currently a real bare-bones backend (I generate the images myself, that's why it takes 2 days) but if it is successful I'll automate the backend and maybe even add features like animated video and stuff.<br><br>I started working on this project exactly a year ago, but took a long break from launching my own startups. But now I'm back in full swing so expect some more AI startups like these very soon!<br><br>ProductHunt viewers can get 25% off when using the promocode \"PH25OFF\".</p>"

This disrupts your workflow and makes it harder to keep track of changes.\n\nOn top of that, LLM chat tools don\u2019t work seamlessly with every dev environment\u2014but we\u2019re already used to working in a browser. So instead of changing your IDE or workflow, FirstRowChat enhances the browser-based LLM experience, removing the tedious task of copy-pasting and losing track of what changed.\n\n\u26a1 Solution\nFirstRowChat lets you:\n\u2705 Attach files from your local system and edit them with an LLM.\n\u2705 Apply changes instantly, no copy-pasting.\n\u2705 Use multiple LLMs like OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini.\n\u2705 Try it for free, bring your own API keys, or subscribe and use our managed API keys.\n\u2705 Works in your browser, but edits your actual files\u2014IDE-agnostic.\n\n\ud83d\udcac What people are saying\nDax on Twitter said:\n\ud83d\udce2 \"This is a very good flow and every LLM app needs to copy it.\"\n\ud83d\udd17 Read the tweet here: <a href=\"https://x.com/thdxr/status/1894461503639638165\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://x.com/thdxr/status/18944...</a>\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Try it out!\nWould love to hear what you think! What LLMs do you use the most? How do you integrate AI into your coding?"

A company just released earnings\u2014&gt; what does it mean? \nEvery time, I had to dig through endless, unstructured financial data to get an answer.\n\nThat\u2019s why we've built Rize. You ask a financial question, and we don\u2019t just give you an answer. We show you exactly how we got there by listing every step RizeAI takes, from data sources to expert-driven insights. And because numbers are best understood visually, we built Generative UI, meaning Rize creates custom charts based on your exact question.\n\nWe\u2019re now launching (08th of March), and we\u2019d love for you to be part of it!

            "body": "- Who I am:\nA little background about me as the owner of the project. I've always been interested in trading and always wanted to work on creating my own trading project. I had background in ML, so I decided to do was utilize this in trading. You might be wondering why I decided to make this open source. There's potentially a lot to lose, but I would beg to differ.\n\n- Why Open Source:\nFrom the moral standpoint, when I was in uni and wanted to code my first automated trading bot, I remembered there was practically no publicly available trading bot. It was mostly trading gurus promoting their classes to get money or their channel to get revenue. This was something I promised myself many years ago if I do create a successful trading bot I will open source it so other people can potentially use my project to create better trained models or projects. Another thing is opportunity. I was able to learn a lot from critique. I had one open source trading project before - which is now defunct - but back then I was able to meet different people with different background ranging from quant developers at respectable prop trading firms to individuals who were just interested attending the same class as me. This interaction allowed me to learn what aspects I needed to improve this project on as well as learn new strategies that they used in their pilot / research programs. That's what's special about open source. You get to meet people you never thought you will meet before the project started.\n\n- What My Project Does\nMost prop trading firms / investment companies have their own ML models. I don't claim that mine is better than theirs. To be honest, we are outperforming a vast majority of them at the current moment (there are 6000+ trading firms we are tracking in terms of their portfolio). This is only 2 months since it's gone live so that might mean nothing in the grand scheme of things. Backtesting results for v3.0.1 showed favorable results with Max Draw-Down at 9.29%, R ratio at 1.91, Sortino at 2.73 and Sharpe ratio at 2.19. A lot of the training and backtesting as well as trading + ranking aspect is well documented in README.md for those interested in using the system for their own. We essentially use a ML technique called Ensemble Learning that uses agents. These agents range from simple strategies in TA-Lib to more proprietary agents (we plan to make this feature open source as well) that model trades done by each investment firms (as posted on marketbeat and changes in portfolio value on 13f reports). The ensemble learning part occurs behind the scene with each agent's parameters ((skew, flip ratio etc.) - there's about 82 parameters) being contorted in different ways in a controlled manner so that it's fine tuned with agents from same class being given feedback loop to their respective control files. This is done using 1m tick from Intrinio although we anticipate moving to Databento. The open source version is not the same as our proprietary one but it has the same framework (mostly because a lot of services we use are paid). We want our users to be able to use AmpyFin without having to pay a single cent.\n\n- Target Audience\nInstitutional traders want to benchmark their trading AI agents against other publicly available agents without having to share their proprietary models, and retail investors want clear, AI-driven trading signals without analyzing complex strategies themselves, so, Ampyfin solves both problems by ranking multiple trading agents\u2014including strategies, investment portfolios, and AI models\u2014and assigning decision weights to generate the most optimal buy/sell signal for each ticker\n\n- Comparison\nThere really isn't any application like this out there to be fair. A lot of trading systems utilize one complex strategy and still use human traders. Signals are there for the human traders. In terms of for retail investors, a lot of application require private information to access their data. We don't. We don't require any personal information to use our application.\n\n- The Team\nTo be quite frank, we are currently a small team spread out in different locations. We're all software engineers full time. We mostly work on the project Friday evening - Sunday evening. There's no set amount of time one needs to work. The team is just there so that our efforts are united in pushing out certain features by a certain flexible timeframe while grabbing a pint. We all stand by the same goal for the project which is keeping and keeping the project open-source, providing full transparency to our users, and maintaining it so that it is free to use. In fact, currently, we're using Open AI's Pro+ for the LLM side to scrape data from Benzinga and Marketbeat but we're implementing an effective web scrapping tool for out users to use in the open source version."

Venice solves two major problems with mainstream AI:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Privacy</strong>: Every prompt sent to ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini is stored forever, attached to your identity, and shared with governments, hackers, and various third parties. Venice never stores your conversations - they live only in your browser. Venice can't share or spy on your convos because it doesn't have them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Censorship</strong>: Major AI platforms heavily restrict outputs based on opaque content policies. Venice gives you access to powerful models without adding extra restrictions. This leads to free thought and open exploration of ideas. </p></li></ol><p>We\u2019ve integrated leading open-source models like DeepSeek, Meta\u2019s Llama, Qwen, and Flux, giving you access to cutting-edge AI that rivals or exceeds closed-source options while protecting your privacy.<a href=\"http://privacy.Cool\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"> </a><br><br>Features you\u2019ll love as a Venice Pro user:</p><ul><li><p>Character creation for custom AI personalities</p></li><li><p>Unrestricted image generation with 70+ artistic styles</p></li><li><p>Document analysis for in-depth research</p></li><li><p>Web-enabled models for up-to-date information</p></li><li><p>High-resolution image upscaling</p></li><li><p>Upload images and analyze or extract content from them</p></li></ul><p>You can try it for free, without even signing up.

We tried every \u201cbest-performing\u201d template out there, but responses were rare. People could tell it was just another mass email.\n\nSo, we started pulling company data\u2014things like Google reviews, social media links, and descriptions\u2014to make our outreach more personal. And suddenly, our replies went through the roof. Every call started with:\n\n\"Wow, you really did your research!\"\n\nThe truth? We didn\u2019t. AI did.\n\nThat\u2019s when we decided to turn our system into a product.\n\nSo, what does LeadLake do?\n\n\u2705 Finds unlimited B2B leads (no caps, no limits)\n\u2705 Scrapes deep insights (social media, SEO descriptions, website trackers like Google Analytics &amp; FB Pixel, user reviews, complete tech stacks of the websites)\n\u2705 Writes fully personalized emails &amp; SMS \u2013 based on what a company does, what people say about them, and how your offer fits in\n\u2705 Improves deliverability \u2013 no more copy-paste emails that get flagged as spam\n\u2705 Built-in email verification \u2013 so your emails don\u2019t bounce\n\nWho\u2019s it for?\n\nIf you do cold outreach\u2014whether you\u2019re in SaaS, consulting, real estate, marketing, or even a local business\u2014LeadLake helps you find leads and send emails people actually want to read.\n\nWhy use LeadLake?\n\nMost tools either limit your leads, require manual scraping, or only let you personalize a couple of variables like {first_name} or {company_name}. LeadLake\u2019s AI actually understands a company\u2014its reviews, pain points, and what they care about\u2014so your emails don\u2019t feel like spam.\n\nIf this sounds interesting, try LeadLake for free for two weeks and let us know what you think in the comments.

It's powered by Gemini 2.0 and lets you generate entire, runnable Colab notebooks just by describing your analysis goals in natural language.<br><br>Here's how it works:<br><br>1. Upload Data: CSV, JSON, or .txt files (up to 1GB).<br>2. Describe Your Goal: Tell it what you want to do (e.g., \"visualize trends,\" \"build a prediction model,\" \"clean the data\").<br>3. Get a Notebook: The agent generates a complete Colab notebook with the necessary code, libraries, and analysis.<br><br>It's a full workflow, ready to run and customize. It can handle things like:<br><br>\u2728 Data Cleaning: Filling in missing values.<br>\ud83d\udcca Visualization: Creating charts and graphs.<br>\ud83e\uddee Statistical Analysis: Calculating correlations, etc.<br>\ud83e\udd16 Machine Learning: Training models (like random forests).<br><br>It's free to use in Colab (with some compute limits, of course), and supports multiple languages.

They take too much time, get confusing, and cost way more than they should.\nWe had seen this struggle before. My co-founder was a senior SWE freelancer before Sonetz, so he had dealt with this firsthand. Clients would ask for proper contracts, and every time, it was a hassle. Either too complicated, too expensive, or just plain annoying to deal with. Whether hiring or freelancing, we kept running into the same problem.\n\nAt some point, we asked ourselves, why is this still so complicated?\n\nSo we built Docwelo, a super simple way to get NDAs, Employment, and Service Agreements done in minutes for just $2 per doc. No back-and-forth and no unnecessary costs for standard contracts. Just quick, easy agreements so you can focus on building instead of paperwork.\n\nV1 of Docwelo is live at docwelo.com! \nWould love to hear your thoughts.

Here are a few things I've been using ai.pw for:</p><ul><li><p>A dedicated Proton Mail for the Operator</p></li><li><p>An account for paywalled media (Bloomberg, NYT, etc.)</p></li><li><p>A dedicated account for social media platforms (not my main account)</p></li></ul><p>Give it a spin and let me know what you think! You can begin using ai.pw for free. If you need to store more than 3 different credentials, you can subscribe using <strong>AIPWFORPH</strong> to get 50% off.</p><br><p><em>Additional fun offer</em></p><p>I've been pushing the Operator to try using different apps and websites for the past month.

There are literally thousands &amp; thousands of AI tools out there. \n\nProfessionals and business owners need help. Adopting AI would be a lot easier if they didn't have to manually research and figure out, often through trial and error, if an AI tool is, or isn't, suitable for their specific use case. \n\nThat's when I had the idea:\n\nWhat if we could use AI, to help people use AI? \n\nA connector. A middle-man. \n\nIt would de-risk it for everyone. Less time wasted researching + less money wasted testing mediocre AI tools. \n\nAnd, it would be completely non-partisan. An honest advisor. Not a sponsored content creator. \n\nThat's how MyPerfectAI was born.\n\nProvided with a brief description of the task at hand, our system sifts through a curated database of high-quality, professional-grade AI tools to recommend the most relevant AI solutions for you. \n\n---\n\nOur MVP is now live! <a href=\"https://www.myperfectai.app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://www.myperfectai.app/</a>\n\nPlease feel free to test it out and drop me any feedback at <a href=\"mailto:josh@myperfectai.app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">josh@myperfectai.app</a>\n\nIf you'd like to follow along our journey, here's our LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/myperfectai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://www.linkedin.com/company...</a>\n\nAlso, subscribe to our newsletter, The AI Briefing: <a href=\"https://theaibriefingbymyperfectai.beehiiv.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://theaibriefingbymyperfect...</a>\nThe most important AI news each week, simplified for non-technical readers.\n\nNote: at the moment our database only has ~130 tools listed.

Normally, she enjoyed browsing, but this time was different\u2014she was searching for something very specific. Pinterest\u2019s search wasn\u2019t matching her search terms, she couldn\u2019t find the exact look she had in mind.  \n\nSensing her confusion, I suggested to her why not create it yourself using prompt? I had a Midjourney subscription and figured AI could generate something unique. She was intrigued and gave it a try. But the results were shockingly underwhelming.\n\nI wondered if it was just a bad prompt or if AI really struggled with nail art. So, I went across different AI image generators to see the output. To my surprise, the results weren\u2019t just bad .. they were absolutely awful. The AI messed up fingers, I saw palms with 2 fingers, 3 fingers, some fingers inverted going inside the palm and so on .. very disturbing.\n\nThat\u2019s when I saw an opportunity. Nail art is a high-interest category, with millions of people constantly looking for inspiration. Yet, current AI models weren\u2019t tuned for this at all. While AI could generate impressive landscapes and portraits, it completely failed at something as precise and detailed as nail designs.  \n\nSo, I decided to fine-tune an AI model specifically for nail art. Instead of people scrolling endlessly through Pinterest or Reddit for inspiration, I wanted to create something built exclusively for generating beautiful, custom nail designs effortlessly. \n\nAnd that\u2019s how I created Nailvana ART A inspiration generator that helps nail enthusiasts, professionals, and casual users alike explore and create the perfect nail designs in seconds. No more guesswork, no more mismatched searches just instant inspiration at your fingertips.  \n\nWould love to hear your thoughts! Have you ever struggled to find the perfect nail design online? \ud83d\udc85\ud83d\ude80"
