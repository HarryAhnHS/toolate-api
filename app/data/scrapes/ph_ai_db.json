The real challenge isn\u2019t typing speed, it\u2019s writing high-quality <strong>infra-aware code</strong> that fits your stack and scales with your team. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve built at AutonomyAI.<br></p><p>\ud83e\udde0 Our first product, <strong>The Magician</strong>, turns Figma designs into clean, production-ready React code by deeply understanding your codebase\u2014its components, structure, and conventions.</p><p><br>To make that possible, we didn\u2019t start with generation.
