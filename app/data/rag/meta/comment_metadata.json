Now, as a piano and guitar player, I love performing, but granny's worsening hearing loss made it hard for her to hear my music.</p><p>I've explored advanced technologies to restore granny's hearing, but none were effective. She smiled as I played, but she could no longer hear the melodies. <br><br>\ud83c\udfb5 Inspired by Apple's Haptic Engine, I build oMoo - a totally new music player, to offer a new way to <strong>experience music through hand, not just ear</strong>. <br>\ud83e\uddcf I believe oMoo will bring the power and beauty of music to everyone, including people who are deaf or hard of hearing like my granny. <br><br>\ud83c\udf81 Join us in the comments, we'd love to hear from you!</p>",

Or sometimes, they'd just translate the idiom into something equivalent in the target language. Thus losing the color of the original phrasing.  This is terrible for language learners.\n\nSeeing this actually inspired me to build something specifically to help with that problem: BestFuckingTranslator.com. The goal is to provide translations that capture the meaning and nuance of idiomatic expressions, in addition to the literal words. Both of those things are important for language learners. \n \n\nHere an of example of how it handles things differently:\n\nEnglish to Spanish:\n\nPhrase: \"You need to bite the bullet and tell him.\"\n\nGoogle Translate: \"Tienes que agarrar la bala y decirle.\" (Doesn't make sense in Spanish)\n\nBestFingTranslator: \"Tienes que morder la bala y dec\u00edrselo. (Necesitas enfrentarte a la situaci\u00f3n y hablar con \u00e9l.)\"\n\nSource text can be in basically any language in the world. The AI does a good job of detecting it.

If you're building AI apps or features, you can use this to monitor your LLM calls for cost, usage, and performance issues.\n\nThe project includes a Tinybird backend to store and process LLM call events, and a Next app frontend to visualize critical LLM metrics such as cost by model, TTFT, total requests/tokens used, etc. All of the visualizations can be filtered and drilled down by a bunch of different dimensions.\n\nWe designed this to be used as is: you can deploy it to Vercel/Tinybird for free and instrument your app to start sending LLM calls (you can find examples for LiteLLM and Vercel AI SDK in the repo).\n\nThe app also includes a template for adding multi-tenancy via Clerk. This can be useful if you'd like to modify the components and integrate them into your app to give your users visibility over their LLM usage in your application.\n\nWe'd love to hear your feedback and how you might use/extend this. Of course, it's open source, and PRs are welcome!\n\nIf you have any questions, the Tinybird Slack community has answers :)",

    "text": "<p>\ud83d\udc4b Hey Hunters! I'm Zach, and here's my story\u2026<br><br>About a year ago I started building custom AI chatbots for businesses\u2014everyone from authors to e-commerce stores, insurance brokers, hospitality teams, even observatories were interested. But I kept running into the same problem:<br>Manually gathering data, embedding it, setting up RAG pipelines, and writing prompt logic over and adjusting it until they clients where happy was very tedious. The clients and I would meet for a hour or so, then I would code the prompts, then we would iterate on this process until they were happy. I thought there had to be a better way so we could do the part both I and the business owners enjoyed doing during our meeting which was training the assistants.<br><br>Eventually, I thought:<br>\u201cWhat if business owners could just train and customize their own ai chatbot\u2014without needing me to code it for them every time? Or what if we could manage it for them so we can quickly train them together in our meetings so they can have them deployed to their customers faster? (also less work for me lol)\u201d<br><br>That sparked everything.<br>The first problem was what was the best way to input the business information that was the least amount of work. For the majority of clients uploading documents and using RAG was easy enough. But then other business owners didn't want to do that much work and requested an easier way. I checked out other solutions that used a UI you can drag &amp; drop lines to different knowledge bases but I knew business owners would loose focus quickly. The second option was let them just add their url and the app would gather business information for them. This seemed to be the fastest way for them to create an ai chatbot and it was the most requested feedback, so I began creating an ai agent that would go out, scrape the data, return it. But this led to a problem where there was too much unnecessary data being scraped (as well as huge context windows for the LLMs) so I had to create another agent that could continuously look at the data coming in, organize it, and them re-organize it at the end to an official knowledge source that was useable by the businesses customer service chatbots. <br><br>So after iterating on the feedback now it's pretty much an ai studio that's a dashboard for designing and training customer service agents. It's general purpose since I currently using the app to solve my own problem by managing clients in various industries chatbots, but feel free to use it for your use case. <br><br>That\u2019s how SmarterChatbots.com was born.<br><br>Now you can: \u2705 Auto-train a chatbot from your website or documents<br>\u2705 Customize the look, tone, and behavior<br>\u2705 Embed it anywhere or share via QR code<br>\u2705 Go live in under 10 minutes<br><br>I\u2019ll admit, I was nervous to hit \u201claunch\u201d here\u2014Product Hunt is full of amazing products, and things might still break \ud83d\ude05\u2014but this is my shot. I\u2019d love for you to give it a try.<br><br>Some fun chatbot ideas people have created on our platform: <br>\u2705 An author of children's books trained various characters on the books and added the QR code to the end of her book so kids could interact and play a game with the characters. Each character was context aware of who they were and where they were in the story. <br>\u2705 My friend who owns a mobile auto mechanic business created one to diagnose preliminary auto issues and help him estimate pricing. <br>\u2705 A few businesses in the hospitality industry created chatbots trained to engage in customers to answer questions about what the experience is like, ticket pricing, menu &amp; drink options and events that where hidden on their website.  <br><br>\ud83d\udcac Feedback, feature requests, or even \u201cthis part was confusing\u201d messages are all welcome.<br>This indie project is all about learning how to make training and deploying AI chatbots truly effortless.<br><br>Thanks for being here \ud83d\ude4f<br>\u2014 Zach</p>",

It's incredibly powerful!\n\n    But here's the challenge: moving those cool MCP integrations from a local setup to a secure, shared production or enterprise environment brings a whole new set of critical requirements. Suddenly, you need robust answers to:\n\n        Who is really making this request in a multi-user system? (AuthN)\n\n        Are they authorized to use this specific tool or access that sensitive data? (RBAC)\n\n        How do we securely manage and inject API keys for shared services without scattering secrets? (Credentials)\n\n        How do we get reliable audit logs for security monitoring and compliance? (Auditing)\n\n    Implementing this essential governance layer consistently across every MCP tool is complex, repetitive, and easy to get wrong.\n\n    That's why I built the Ithena SDK! It's an open-source (Apache-2.0) TypeScript library designed specifically to provide this missing enterprise-grade governance layer for your MCP servers.\n\n    Ithena gives you a pluggable pipeline to easily add Identity, RBAC, Credential Management, and Auditing capabilities, letting your team focus on building great MCP features, knowing the security and compliance aspects are handled consistently.\n\n    While you could use parts of it locally, its real power is unlocked when deploying MCP services where security, compliance, and observability are non-negotiable.\n\n    We also have a waitlist open for an optional Managed Platform if you want hosted, production-ready backends for these interfaces later.\n\n    Dive into the GitHub repo and docs to see how it works!\n\n    Curious to hear: How are you tackling security and governance when taking MCP tools beyond local experiments and into shared or production environments? What are the biggest hurdles you've faced?\n\n    Cheers!",

And the ones I have checked - chats are saved unencrypted to disk by default! While some of them now supports remote models, I wanted a more simplified and efficient UI for switching AI models and providers.<br><br>With providers like DeepInfra.com / Together.ai with Nvidia H100 GPU's that can run high parameter / mixture of expert models like DeepSeek, and that chat logging is often off by default with developer accounts, this gave me the idea that I don't need run expensive servers with GPUs to get privacy, as long as the client is secure as well. <br><br>I have built pre-configured Profiles for GPT-4o, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, and Grok with a 'one-click' setup using your own API keys.

The app's simplicity, efficiency, and familiarity, inspired by MS Teams, are intended to make it easy for users to switch between AI models, such as GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek, using pre-configured profiles and one-click setup with their own API keys. Ultimately, LLMSymphony is positioned as a solution for individuals who value their privacy and want to minimize exposure to data breaches, while also seeking a seamless and efficient way to engage with cutting-edge AI models, all at an affordable price point of $12 for a lifetime of upgrades.",

The tone of the comment suggests that users value authenticity and are disheartened to see what they perceive as a prank being given prominence over potentially more innovative and deserving products. This sentiment implies that the community places a high importance on the credibility and integrity of the products featured on the platform, and that they expect a more rigorous evaluation process to ensure that only legitimate and meaningful products are showcased. The fact that ElevenLabs Text to Bark, with its seemingly absurd promise of converting text into fluent barking using AI, was featured without proper verification has eroded trust and sparked calls for more discerning curation, particularly when it comes to products from well-known brands, which may be given undue preference.",

    "text": "Hey PH community!\n\nToday, we\u2019re launching DGi after months of hunkering down and pair programming with my CTO. Our journey over the past seven years has been full of ups and downs: we scaled a martech company to around 160 people, but when COVID hit, we couldn\u2019t fully bounce back. Our team dissolved, and only my CTO stayed on to keep searching for product-market fit with almost no resources.\n\nDespite it all, we built a pretty cool data workflow product used by several Fortune 500 companies. It felt too cumbersome and time consuming\u2014but it made us profitable. We took that lesson and poured our learnings into our next big bet.\n\nRather than seeing the past as failure, we saw it as proof that every struggle, every pivot, and every lesson would lead us here, stronger than ever.\n\nWhat is DGi?\nSimply put, DGi is an AI agent specialized in data that builds and it is entirely built by AI. It isn\u2019t locked into any fixed front or back end. At its core, it embodies \u201cvisual empathy\u201d: we give you a sleek interface for adding credentials, so you\u2019re not wrangling config files. We let you interact visually, not just via chat. And, of course, we deliver dashboards that are both appealing and easy to navigate.\nWe built DGi using Next.js and Shadcn components because we admire Guillermo\u2019s (Founder of Vercel) philosophy and wanted to bring that same level of tasteful design into the data space.\n\nIn a nutshell with DGi you can:\nConnect to your data or upload files\nCreate dashboards or ask questions about your data\nRun code\nSchedule tasks to orchestrate (just like Airflow)\nIn essence we are a combination between ChatGPT, v0 and Airflow.\nMore on DGi at <a href=\"http://www.dgintel.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">www.dgintel.ai</a>\n\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\nWe believe data exploration should be AI-based from the start. Eventually, tools like Excel and Power BI may fade away if a single product can handle everything\u2014uploading a CSV, connecting a database, creating dashboards, asking questions, and automating workflows. That\u2019s our dream, and DGi is the first step toward making it real.\n\nWe hope you love it as much as we do. You can try it now, for free.\n\nPlus here\u2019s our commitment, if you try it out and you find a bug or want a feature we don\u2019t have, we will fix it or implement it right away.  We know there\u2019s many things to improve. For example we want to update users while DGi is \u201cThinking\u201d. We will bring streaming very soon.\n\nAlso, share what you built with the hashtag #dgi and tag us @datagran on X by April 15 for a chance to win $1,000. The most impressive implementation takes it.\n\nFinally we\u2019ve raised more than $5m thus far but we are opening a community round on Wefunder to give anyone the chance to invest in the future of data <a href=\"https://wefunder.com/datagran\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://wefunder.com/datagran</a>",

It started after the birth of my second daughter, Athena, when I was trying to find a way to effectively remember all the hacks and insights I learned each day. I needed a system that both kept me organized with as little work possible, but more importantly, one that reminded me of the information when I needed it. </p><br><p>Yes, I tried my phone's note-taking app (along with some others). We can all agree that the note-taking apps out there are messy, overly complicated, and cannot make the data actionable. There was no way they would help me remember to order a different meal next time I come back to this restaurant.\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f</p><br><p>So I decided to build an all-in-one solution...an app that functions like a second brain. </p><br><p>MYNDIFY has:</p><p>\u2705 A pre-built infrastructure to organize your mental notes.

So when I go back to Bob's Bistro, MYNDIFY can remind me (automatically) not to order that meal again. </p><p>\u2705 AI generated answers to our questions. With MYNDIFY's Inky chatbot, you can get answers to questions like \"What was the name of the place I took the kids apple picking?\" or \"Which of my friends is vegan?\". </p><br><p>These are just some of the many features MYNDIFY has!</p><br><p>I, along with some of the other early adopters, are obsessed with how useful it is. I absolutely LOVE getting reminders like what to ask the doctor about during our pediatric visits. What about you? How useful is your notes app? What would you love to get reminders for?</p><br>",

    "text": "<p>\ud83d\udc4b Hey Product Hunt!<br></p><p>I\u2019m the founder of Surfly, where we\u2019ve been building co-browsing technology since 2012. Over the last decade, we\u2019ve helped companies enable real-time collaboration on the web. As part of co-browsing, you need to be able to share any web session. To do that, we built a technology that can <em>take any existing web application and turn it into a virtual session</em> \u2014 one that\u2019s shareable, customizable, and collaborative. That underlying capability ended up being our biggest breakthrough.<br></p><br><p><strong>Why we\u2019re launching Webfuse</strong></p><br><p>Over the years, we\u2019ve seen a few of our most creative customers build <em>incredible</em> tools on top of our tech. They used it to translate legacy applications in real time, sandbox existing web application for privacy, inject new UI into legacy tools, and even power AI-driven assistants that run inside existing web apps.</p><br><p>We always wanted to explore this potential further \u2014 but we weren\u2019t ready. the technology wasn\u2019t mature enough to open up broadly. So we focused on a small group of customers, iterated quietly\u2026 and now, we\u2019re finally ready to share what we\u2019ve built with the world. Introducing <em>Webfuse</em> \u2014 world's first <em>Web Augmentation Platform</em>.</p><p><br><br></p><p><strong>Why nobody else has done this</strong></p><br><p>Until now, your options for modifying existing web apps were limited to:</p><ul><li><p>\ud83d\udd0c <em>Browser extensions</em> (local, requires installation)</p><ul><li><p>eg: <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/plasmo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@Plasmo</a> <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/extensionpay\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@ExtensionPay</a> <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/chatgpt-sidebar-chrome-extension\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@Sider: AI Research Agent &amp; Extension</a> <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/keepitcloaked\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@Cloaked</a> <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/merlin-chatgpt-powered-browser-cmd-g\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@Merlin - ChatGPT powered chrome extension (Cmd+M)</a> <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/frase\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@Frase</a> <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/monica-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@Monica</a> <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/subtly\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@Subtly</a> <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/factory-confirm-by-sourcify\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@Factory Confirm by Sourcify</a> , ...</p></li></ul></li><li><p>\ud83c\udf10 <em>Remote browsers</em> (lower quality as you are streaming pixels)</p></li><li><p>\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f <em>CDN/Edge code injection</em> (requires infrastructure control)</p></li></ul><p>But Webfuse is different. We rewrite the application in real-time and run it in a controlled environment \u2014 one where we can change, monitor, and extend it as needed. It\u2019s a technically complex problem, especially with how fast the web evolves \u2014 but after 10+ years of experience building in this space, we\u2019ve finally cracked it.</p><p><br><br></p><p><strong>How it works</strong></p><br><p>Webfuse wraps any existing web application in a thin virtualization layer \u2014 a \u201cvirtual session\u201d \u2014 where everything can be customized without touching the original source. Once you sign up, you can create a <em>SPACE</em>, which is essentially a smart, shareable link that opens a set of virtualized web apps. From there, you can:</p><ul><li><p>Modify the UI</p></li><li><p>Add security/authentication</p></li><li><p>Inject automation</p></li><li><p>Record &amp; monitor sessions</p></li><li><p>Share with others (like multiplayer mode for any app)</p></li></ul><p>All without needing source code access.</p><p><br><br></p><p><strong>Features</strong></p><ul><li><p>\ud83d\udd10 <em>Security Layers</em> \u2013 Add auth, HTTP-only cookie isolation, audit logs</p></li><li><p>\ud83d\udcf9 <em>Session Recording</em> \u2013 Full video streams of interactions</p></li><li><p>\ud83d\udcc8 <em>Monitoring &amp; Logs</em> \u2013 Real-time JSON-based session audit trail</p></li><li><p>\ud83e\udd16 <em>Automation</em> \u2013 Remote control API for bots and agents</p></li><li><p>\ud83e\udd1d <em>Collaboration</em> \u2013 Share sessions with multiple users in real-time</p></li><li><p>\ud83c\udfa5 <em>Video Chat</em> \u2013 Add video calls to <em>any</em> web app</p></li><li><p>\ud83e\udde9 <em>Custom Extensions</em> \u2013 Build and inject your own logic using a browser-extension-like API<br><br></p></li></ul><p><strong>Why Webfuse is unique</strong></p><br><p>Webfuse enables a new category: Web Augmentation. Instead of building a new app from scratch or waiting for vendors to release features, you can build on top of what already exists \u2014 instantly. You can even turn browser extensions into managed SaaS tools without client-side installs. Whether you're a developer, founder, automator, or hacker \u2014 this is your canvas to remix the web.</p><p><br><br></p><p><strong>Our roadmap</strong></p><p>We\u2019re just getting started. Right now, Webfuse supports the basics of the browser extension API. Based on your feedback, we\u2019ll expand the capabilities, improve performance, and build a full ecosystem around this idea \u2014 including:</p><ul><li><p>Extension marketplace</p></li><li><p>No-code UI builder</p></li><li><p>AI assistants integration</p></li><li><p>Private cloud deployment<br></p></li></ul><p><strong>Join us early \u2014 let\u2019s build together</strong></p><br><p>We\u2019re offering <strong>$100 in credits </strong>for Product Hunt users.

    "text": "9 months ago, I quit my 6-year role at a startup. I felt lost and didn\u2019t know what I was going to do with my life. One evening, I realized I had no time left in my day anymore, and something had changed. I was holding my iPhone 15 Pro Max, and I couldn\u2019t understand why I was spending so much more time on it compared to my old slow Android phone. This phone was different. The shimmering colors on the screen invited me to keep using it, and everything was buttery smooth. Apps on the main screens were all bright and colorful, making it so easy to engage with.\n\nI started thinking about how things were when I had my old Samsung my battery would die every 3-4 hours. Yet now, with this iPhone, I found myself constantly plugged in. It dawned on me that I didn\u2019t even know screen time existed. On the iPhone, it\u2019s buried somewhere hard to find, almost as if they were hiding it. It looked like something from the 1990s an old graph, nothing like the sleek and beautiful health app graphs they charge for.\n\nThat\u2019s when I began digging deeper into how social media uses behavioral psychology to manipulate us. I learned how they employed thousands of psychologists to make their platforms as addictive as possible. One simple example? The little circles at the end of a story showing who viewed it. Suddenly, you're in the middle of doing something, but you want to check who saw your story. The pressure mounts, especially when you're somewhere expensive like traveling and you feel like you have to post about it. You\u2019re not posting for you; you\u2019re posting to be the mule for your friends who can\u2019t live the life you\u2019re living.\n\nAs someone who got into coding to build the life I wanted, I started noticing how the addiction to these platforms was making everyone else miss out on the real world. On a train, I saw 9 out of 10 people doomscrolling. Kids waking up, stuck on their phones all weekend. It hit me: I hated everything about social media.\n\nI decided the next product I needed to create had to be about data science and AI, combining both passions to create something that could help people regain control of their time. That\u2019s how Blissio.ai was born.\n\nBlissio.ai is a personalized digital wellness tool. It asks simple questions like your age, profession, and hobbies, and based on those, it creates focus sessions tailored specifically for you. We block apps based on what you need, whether for work, your hobbies, or age group. This way, we\u2019re not arbitrarily blocking things, but helping you focus on what matters most.\n\nI\u2019m so excited to share this with you all! How do you manage your screen time? Would love to hear your thoughts below! \ud83d\udc47",

Whether it was fantasy RPGs or sci-fi worlds, I kept needing unique names and coming up with them manually was slowing me down. \n\nSo I made a tool that lets you just describe what you need and get instant, AI-generated name suggestions. No logins, no limits, totally free. It now works for everything from business names to fantasy characters. Hope it helps other creators save time like it did for me.\n\nThank you for checking this tool out!",

However, instead of empowering their users, most of these modern, high-powered apps cause users to become confused and lost. The average user, especially a new one, has a low attention span, isn't an expert with your app, and doesn't care about it\u2014causing them to click away or leave your app as soon as they can't figure something out. \n\n\u2728 What is Limeblock\n\nA common solution to this problem is a chatbot widget - there's one on ProductHunt too!

You can create Master Threads as major categories for your activities - like Sales &amp; Partnerships, Marketing Team, User Feedback &amp; Insights, etc.\n\nUnder each Master Thread, you can create Daughter Threads to categorize information further. For example, under User Feedback &amp; Insights, I have subcategories like Customizable Dashboard Requested, Early User Feedback, and more.\n\nWithin each Daughter Thread, I add entries. For instance, under the user feedback category \"Request for Mobile App,\" I log all feedback related to that request.\n\nThis architecture not only helps me stay organized but also allows me to chat with my notes using AI. Before a call, I just hit the \u2018Get Synopsis\u2019 button, and it gives me a summary of all relevant entries.\n\nUntil last week, in the application, I was using GPT-3.5 Turbo and Gemini 2.0 for personal AI purposes.

    "text": "Hi folks, Alex here! I'm an alum of the Stanford AI Lab and Y Combinator, and now the CEO of TalkToSales.\n\nToday, I\u2019m proud to announce the launch of TalkToSales, which pioneers a new way people can interact with computers.\n\nTalkToSales adds AI assistants to websites: they can answer visitors' questions, give them live tours of the website or app, and even help them book follow-up calls and buy things right in the conversation.\n\nUnlike traditional websites, which are the same for everyone who visits them, the TalkToSales assistant customizes the conversation and content shown to every visitor, whether the content is dynamic slides, a website/app tour, or both.\n\nTalkToSales also lets the people behind a website offer to \"drop in\" in place of the AI assistant and talk with visitors directly, when visitors accept. Shopkeepers in physical stores have always been able to talk to customers as they browse, but it hasn't been possible to do this on the web until now. We think this could be quite useful for companies that do business online to have more personal engagement with web visitors.\n\nWe think TalkToSales assistants can be helpful for a number of use cases:\n\nSoftware sales: the website itself can become the first sales call, answering visitors' questions, qualifying their good fit and intent, and booking follow-up calls for good leads.\n\nSoftware onboarding and support: Imagine a Clippy that actually worked, talking to you over voice and actually taking actions in a web app for you as you ask it for how to do things.\n\nE-commerce: Imagine having a personal shopper on e.g. the Home Depot website, where a virtual man in an orange apron could show you different dishwasher models and help you pick between them.\n\nReal estate: Imagine going to an apartment building's website and having a virtual real estate agent answer your questions, give you virtual tours of apartments, and book you for a real-world tour.\n\n(Any other ideas? We're all ears!)\n\nWe think TalkToSales assistants can also be very helpful from an analytics point of view - instead of just seeing who visits your page and for how long, imagine being able to see which questions people have, what objections prevent them from engaging deeper, etc. TalkToSales logs transcripts of conversations and the AI can surface patterns from those conversations from you.\n\nPlease try it out and let us know what you think! And if you know anyone else who'd be interested in this, I'd appreciate you sharing it with them.",

    "text": "<p><strong>Can AI Make Good Music?</strong><br><br>My answer is an unequivocal yes- and that\u2019s why I co-founded <a href=\"https://flowhop.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Flowhop AI</a>, where we\u2019re using the latest generative tech to create killer lofi hip-hop beats.<br><br>If the words \u201cAI\u201d and \u201chip-hop\u201d in the same sentence are enough to pique your interest, feel free to check it out now. But if you like a good origin story, read on.<br><br><strong>The Blissful Years</strong><br><br>I was fortunate to grow up in a musical household and started playing music at a young age. I stayed active in bands from high school through my thirties.<br><br>Despite my love for music, I realized early on that it wasn\u2019t an ideal way to make a living. For that, I turned to coding.<br><br>The thing about coding is it demands long stretches of uninterrupted screen time. And like many developers, I needed a soundtrack.<br><br>For years, that soundtrack could be just about anything: bebop jazz, thrash metal, gritty hip-hop, hardcore punk\u2014even some country. The genre didn\u2019t matter. I could listen to whatever I liked and still stay focused, productive, and incrementally happier.<br><br><strong>The Turning Point</strong><br><br>Then, a few years ago- though I\u2019m not sure exactly when- something strange happened. <br><br>After a lifetime of voracious and wonderfully promiscuous music consumption, I found I could no longer listen to most music while working. It had become a distraction. Especially hip-hop, with its vivid imagery and clever wordplay, pulled my attention away from the work.<br><br>This was a bummer, to say the least, but it led to my discovery of lofi hip-hop. <br><br>The instrumental, often chilled-out, beats were perfect. It became my go-to music whenever I needed to lock in at the keyboard for a few hours.<br><br><strong>The Problem</strong><br><br>Chances are, some of you are also fans of lofi hip-hop. A quick search on YouTube will confirm its popularity. But after a couple of years listening to the top channels, I started to get bored.<br><br>I heard the same tracks a bit too often, and many of the beats shared a bit too much of the same sound palette.<br><br>I wanted more: more variety, more diversity, and more music that sounded like the golden era of sample-based hip-hop I grew up loving.<br><br><strong>AI Changes the Game</strong><br><br>A few months ago, I started playing around with the new wave of AI music-generation tools. I wasn\u2019t trying to start anything- I was just curious.<br><br>The early results? Pretty incredible.<br><br>Soon I found myself wondering, \"<em>Can this thing make lofi hip-hop?</em>\"<br><br>After more focused experimentation, I got my answer. Not only could it make lofi beats- some of them were <em>really, really good</em>. It could even make tracks that echoed the soulful, sample-heavy vibe of golden-era hip-hop.<br><br>That\u2019s when the lightbulb went off.<br><br><strong>Flowhop AI</strong><br><br>Once the vision became clear, I started generating songs like a madman\u2014and recruited one of my best friends (a fellow musician and technologist) to help polish the results for release.<br><br>At <a href=\"https://flowhop.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Flowhop</a>, we\u2019re building the <strong>biggest and best catalog of lofi hip-hop beats on the planet</strong>- music for focus, study, creativity, and flow.<br><br>Whether you\u2019re coding, cramming, writing, or slaying monsters in your favorite game, we want to be your soundtrack.<br><br>Enjoy!</p>",

This led to the discovery of lofi hip-hop, which provided the perfect instrumental and chilled-out beats for focused work, but eventually, the founder became bored with the limited variety and diversity of music available on popular channels. The introduction of AI music-generation tools sparked curiosity, and after experimenting with these tools, the founder was impressed by the high-quality lofi hip-hop beats that could be produced, echoing the soulful and sample-heavy vibe of golden-era hip-hop. This experience inspired the creation of Flowhop AI, which aims to build the largest and best catalog of lofi hip-hop beats, designed to help users focus, study, and be creative, with the goal of becoming the go-to soundtrack for coding, deep work, and other productive activities.

However, the access to legal review is time consuming and costly, so majority of the times, we sign agreements and documents based on 'trust'. However, when trust is broken that is where our signed documents do not help us as we did not review them thoroughly. For example, you signed an NDA thinking that you should not talk about any confidential matter, however, you did realise that the NDA stopped you from even taking the name of the company and now they are suing you because you just took their name. Similarly, you signed a consent form for your child's trip but did not realise that you have waived all rights for mishaps happening due to negligence on the part of school.\n\nPersonas is an AI powered tool which uses vectors to analyse each document in detail. The AI generates the levers based on each document type, where the levers are key aspects under which the document needs to be reviewed. The system also seeks your preferences for each aspect so that the system processes based on your expectations. Finally, in under 2 mins you get the entire document reviewed with each aspect marked as Red, Green or Amber based on the severity of the issue. The best part, if you review such documents regularly, like NDAs coming from various customers, vendors etc, you can create a persona with your preferences and every time a new NDA comes, you can get it reviewed based on your persona with a single click of a button.\n\nGive it a try and let me know if you think it would help you in being safe from signing documents with clauses which can be detrimental to you in the long run.",

I\u2019m Bap, Co-founder at Prompteus.</p><br><p>I\u2019m thrilled to introduce <strong>Prompteus</strong> \u2014 a complete solution to build, deploy, and scale AI workflows.</p><br><p>Over the past few years, I\u2019ve built products with my team for governments and Fortune 500s in highly regulated industries. When LLMs exploded, we started integrating them into everything \u2014 and the same pain points kept popping up:</p><ul><li><p>How do I log requests and track costs?</p></li><li><p>How do I switch models without rewriting my app?</p></li><li><p>How can I make sure the response <em>never</em> says a specific word?</p></li></ul><p>That\u2019s why we built Prompteus.</p><br><p>Instead of hardcoding AI calls all over your stack, Prompteus gives you a <strong>visual workflow editor</strong> to design, manage, and deploy AI logic \u2014 no infra, no spaghetti prompts, no DevOps overhead.</p><br><p>We call these workflows <strong>Neurons</strong>. You drag and drop building blocks (like model calls, conditionals, and transformations) and deploy them as secure API endpoints. They work from your frontend, backend, anywhere. You can even chain Neurons together.</p><br><p>\u2728 Highlights:</p><ul><li><p>Multi-provider orchestration (OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, Cohere, Google\u2026). Change models without changing a line of code.</p></li><li><p>Adaptive <strong>semantic caching</strong> to skip redundant LLM calls. Save on execution time and request cost!</p></li><li><p>Built-in auth, rate limiting, access controls \u2014 call your Neurons from your frontend if you'd like.</p></li><li><p>Detailed per-request logs, and cost analysis down to the microdollar (yup, we had to come up with that one!)</p></li><li><p>Powerful guardrails: catch input/output patterns before they hit the model. A great use case is to remove sensitive information before AI calls.</p></li></ul><br><p>We\u2019ve designed Prompteus so non-devs can contribute. No YAML. No redeploying a whole project for every config tweak.</p><br><p>There\u2019s a generous forever free tier to get started, and we\u2019re already testing some cool new features like tool calling, MCP server support, and more with early users.</p><br><p>Check out <a href=\"https://docs.prompteus.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">the docs</a>, <a href=\"https://prompteus.com/resources\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">watch our videos</a>, try it out, and tell us what you think.

We were looking for other use cases when we realized that LLMs are smart enough to guide users, but only if it knows your product inside-out. For this, we decided to go with the LLM fine-tuning approach. With insights from my partners, we built Navigable AI to simplify the LLM fine-tuning process using a no-code approach, taking care of the heavyweight tasks and avoiding common pitfalls. A side-effect benefit of this process was huge reduction in cost. Because we are able to use a smaller LLM for fine-tuning to get good results, we are saving big on the inference costs.<br><br><strong>What do we need?</strong><br>We\u2019re eager for feedback on both our product idea and execution. If you have any suggestions or questions, please drop them here. And if you like what you see, feel free to share it with others! Also, If you need a customized LLM fine-tuning solution, we can make it happen. Just get in touch and we'll help you out.<br><br></p><p>Thanks for checking out Navigable AI.

Instead of just focusing on conveying my message, I often spend more time making sure it sounds like it came from an educated adult rather than a 3rd grade kiddo.<br><br>No matter how creative or brilliant an idea is, people can misunderstand or even ignore it if the message doesn't come across well. It's pretty understandable, right? If your writing sounds like a third grader's, people subconsciously judge your intelligence.<br><br>I know there are plenty of products out there that can help with this, but I'm a Slacker -- I mean, a big fan of Slack (not an actual slacker, literally). I love Slack and want a tool that integrates seamlessly with it. I want to improve the experience, type faster, and customize my message tone depending on who I'm chatting with. Sure, you can get a lot of these features for free from ChatGPT or other tools, but constantly switching windows, copying and pasting, and manually prompting every time is a pain. I want to do it quickly with no extra steps. That's why I built this tool\u2014for myself and for others.<br><br>I was a Principal Engineer at a Fortune 500 company that takes customer data security seriously by encrypting everything. Working with encrypted data is a PITA, but after dealing with it for so long, it has become second nature to me. Now, I'm addicted to this pain (yeah, it's contagious). All of our products encrypt customer data before storing it in the database, and we rotate keys regularly.<br><br>You've probably heard companies brag about encrypting data at rest and in transit. That comes out of the box with cloud-managed services\u2014but it doesn't mean their employees can't access your data. I'm not saying they'll do anything shady (but who really knows? ahem... me ta). With our approach, data is encrypted using AES-256 before it even reaches the database, making it virtually impossible for anyone to extract meaningful information.<br><br>One more thing -- this particular product doesn't store your messages permanently. They're encrypted in the cache layer for only a short time before the TTL kicks them out. If you disable the preview feature, we won't even cache them.

    "text": "\ud83d\udc4b Hey Hunters,\n\nI\u2019m Jasmin, Co-founder of Gemoo. We\u2019re back with something completely new. \n\nToday, we\u2019re introducing Gemoo, an AI-powered video editing tool that makes content creation effortless.\n\n\ud83c\udfac What\u2019s New in the All-New Gemoo?\n\nGemoo eliminates tedious editing by automating subtitles, B-roll, cuts, and effects, allowing you to create polished, high-quality videos in minutes. Here\u2019s how:\n\n- AI-Powered B-Roll Insertion \u2013 Stop searching for stock footage. Gemoo analyzes your video and auto-inserts relevant B-roll to make your content more dynamic.\n\n-  Auto Subtitles &amp; Custom Captions \u2013 No more manual transcription. Gemoo generates accurate subtitles instantly in 100+ languages, complete with customizable templates that fit your brand.\n\n-  Smart Effects &amp; Dynamic Zooms \u2013 Need to emphasize key points? Gemoo automatically adds zoom-ins, motion effects, and trendy visuals to keep your audience engaged.\n\n-  Edit Video by Editing Text \u2013 No timeline needed! Gemoo allows you to edit your videos as easily as a Google Doc. Simply modify or delete text in the transcript to trim the corresponding video segments.\n\n-  Turn Long Videos into Viral Clips \u2013 AI detects key moments in your video and helps you cut them into short, engaging clips\u2014perfect for YouTube Shorts, TikTok, and Instagram Reels.\n\n-  AI Titles, Descriptions &amp; Hashtags \u2013 Let AI generate optimized video titles, descriptions, and hashtags to improve discoverability and engagement across YouTube, TikTok, and more.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Why We Completely Transformed Gemoo\n\nWhen we first launched Gemoo, it was built as a video messaging tool for communication and collaboration. But as we listened to our users and studied the evolving video landscape, we realized something: content creators, marketers, and businesses needed better, faster ways to create compelling videos.\n\nTraditional editing is time-consuming. Searching for B-roll, manually adding captions, cutting clips for different platforms\u2014it all adds up to hours of work. We wanted to remove the friction from the video creation process and let AI handle the heavy lifting.\nSo, instead of just iterating on the old Gemoo, we boldly decided to rebuild it from scratch\u2014with AI-driven video editing at its core.\n\nThe result? A completely new, smarter, and more intuitive Gemoo. One that makes video editing as fast and effortless as possible, without sacrificing creativity.\n\n\ud83d\udcbc Who Is Gemoo For?\n\u2705 Content Creators &amp; YouTubers \u2013 Create high-quality videos faster and focus on growing your audience.\n\u2705 Social Media Marketers \u2013 Boost engagement with polished, AI-enhanced videos optimized for every platform.\n\u2705 Educators &amp; Course Creators \u2013 Turn lectures into engaging lessons with auto-subtitles and perfect B-roll footage.\n\u2705 Businesses &amp; Agencies \u2013 Scale your video production without increasing your editing workload.\n\n\ud83d\udd0d So, What\u2019s Next?\n\nWe\u2019re thrilled to bring the new Gemoo to you today, and we\u2019d love your feedback! \ud83d\udca1\nYou can try Gemoo for free today \u2013 no credit card required. Just upload a video, let AI handle the tedious tasks, and see how much faster and easier video creation can be.\nWe\u2019d love to hear from you! Drop your thoughts, feedback, or questions in the comments. We\u2019re here all day answering questions and taking notes to keep improving. \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Try Gemoo now: <a href=\"https://gemoo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://gemoo.com/</a>\n\n\ud83d\udcb2What\u2019s more?\nWe\u2019ve prepared an exclusive 20% off coupon for the Product Hunters: PH20OFF.

Second, the agency couldn\u2019t understand why there wasn\u2019t an affordable solution that enabled their team to quickly find insights during client calls or while drafting emails based on previously created content. This sparked the creation of ChatterKB\u2014a tool that lets you build an interactive, AI-driven repository of ideas and insights, much like an evolving newsletter or your own personal assistant, available in both public and private modes.

There are some challenges which are kind of left unanswered due to the lack of knowledge - like anxiety, bad habits, sleeplessness, procrastination and more things like that. What I have found is that there are ton of scientific studies which can help a person answer and solve many of these challenges.
